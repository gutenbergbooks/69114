<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall was a seven months’ child;
the fact is significant of a personality seeking
premature prominence upon this planet.
He spent the first weeks of his infancy wrapped in cotton
wool and placed in a basket as near the fire as safety
allowed. He scaled precisely two pounds fifteen ounces,
and the doctor, who manipulated the weights and was
interested in mathematics, placed two pounds fifteen
ounces over seven months and shook his head forebodingly
at the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If he lives he will be a sickly child, nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This opinion the nurse heartily endorsed, and added, in
tribute to the kindliness of her disposition:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor little thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rendall did not show great concern at the untimely
arrival of her offspring. She accepted it, as she
accepted all things, with phlegmatical calm. A great
deal was required to still Mrs. Rendall’s emotions, so
much, in fact, that it was not within the recollection of
any of her intimates that they ever had been stirred.
It did not occur to her that the birth of a child, mature
or premature, was a matter of moment. If it lived, well
and good, and the best must be done for it. If it died,
the occurrence must be regarded as sad and an occasion
for shedding a given number of tears. It was clearly
useless to foreshadow either event, since one was as likely
as the other and could be as readily treated with when
the time arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not be thought that Mrs. Rendall’s calm was
the result of philosophy. That would be far from the
truth. It occurred simply and solely from a vacant
mind—a mind nourished by the dead-sea fruit of its
own vacuity. She lacked impulse and intelligence, and
was, indeed, no more than a lifeless canal along which
the barges of domesticity were drearily towed. Her
ideas were other people’s, and valueless at that; her conversation
was a mere repetition of things she had said
before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the doctor, rubbing his hands to lend an air of
cheerful optimism to a cheerless situation, declared,
“We shall pull that youngster through, see if we don’t,”
she responded, “Oh, yes,” with a falling inflexion. If
he had said the opposite, her reply would have been the
same—delivered in the same manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In some cases heredity ignores personalities, and this,
in the instance of Wynne Rendall, was hardly difficult
of achievement. From his mother he took nothing, unless
it were a measure of her fragility, which was perhaps
the only circumstance about her to justify attention.
The characteristics that he did not bring into the
world with himself he inherited from his grandfather,
<span class='it'>via</span> his own sire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grandfather was certainly the more notable of
the two gentlemen, and had achieved some astonishing
ideals on canvas, very heartily disapproved of by the
early Victorian era, and some memorable passages of wit
which had heightened his unpopularity. He was an
artist who went for his object with truly remarkable
energy. To seek a parallel among modern men, his
work possessed some of the qualities of Aubrey Beardsley’s,
combined with the vigour of John S. Sargent.
But the world was not ready for such productions, and,
casting its eyes upward in pious horror, hurried from
the walls on which they were exhibited. Old Edward
Tyler Rendall scorned them as they departed, but he
understood the situation notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come too soon,” he mused, “too soon by a generation
or more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His belief in his art was so great that he determined
to sacrifice his liberty and get married, in the hope that
he might have a son who would carry on the work for the
benefit of a world enlightened by broader-minded civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In due course the son was born, and when he reached
an age of understanding, the reason of his being was
dinned into his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get away from old traditions; build something new,
dextrous, adroit, understanding. See what I mean,
Robert boy? Be plucky—plucky in line, composition,
subject. Always have a purpose before you; don’t mind
how offensive it is—no one cares for that if you’ve the
courage to declare your meaning in honest black and
white.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this intensive artistic culture was that
Robert Everett Rendall, at the age of sixteen and a
half, ran away from home and took a position as office
boy in a large firm of tea-tasters in the City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This case presents unusual features, being in itself
an inversion of the usual procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Old Rendall made one heroic effort to win him back,
and stormed the City citadel to that end; but here he
encountered from Robert a metropolitan manner so
paralysing that he fled the office in wholesome disgust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever courageous, he urged his wife to labour anew,
and was rewarded by a daughter who unhappily perished.
The disappointment was acute, and when some
three years later a son was born his energies had so far
abated that he made no further effort to inculcate the
spirit of artistry which had been the essence of his
being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Robert Everett Rendall lived a sober and
honourable life in the City, and heartily abused all matters
pertaining to art. Nothing infuriated him more
than to find himself drawing, with an odd facility,
strange little designs on the corners of his blotting
paper while engaged in thinking out the intricacies connected
with the tasting of tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suppression of a natural ability sometimes produces
peculiar results and the deliberate smothering of
all he had been taught or had inherited from his father
brought about in Robert Everett Rendall a deplorable
irritability and high temper. This he was discreet
enough to keep in hand during City hours, but in his
own home he allowed it full sway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At such times his actions were abnormal. He would
pick up any object convenient to hand and throw it with
surprising accuracy of aim at one or another of the
highly respectable water-colour paintings which adorned
the walls of his abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even in this matter his City training stood him
in good stead, for there was very little spontaneity in
the act. According to the degree of his ill-humour, so
was the target chosen. If he were in a towering rage
the 20x30 drawing of Clovelly would be bound to have
it; and so down the scale of anger to the 10x7 of Beachy
Head. It made no difference whether the picture were
large or small, his projectile struck it with never-failing
precision. The tinkle and crash of the falling glass
seemed to restore his calm, for when the blow had been
struck he returned to more normal habits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Mrs. Rendall been gifted with observation she
would have known exactly, according to his mood, which
picture would fall, and would thus have saved herself
much ducking over the dining-room table. Such conclusions,
however, were beyond the reach of her unsubtle
soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this matter she produced, and
that unintentionally, one of her only flights of humour:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you would throw your serviette ring, Robert, it
would not matter so much, but the salt-cellar makes it
so uncomfortable for every one else.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The news of Wynne’s birth was conveyed to Mr.
Rendall on his doorstep at an inopportune moment.
He had pinched his fingers in the front gate, and followed
this misfortune with the discovery that his latchkey
had been left in another pair of trousers. Few
things irritate a man more than ringing his own door
bell, and Mr. Rendall was no exception to the rule. In
common with the general view, he conceived that the
parlour-maid kept him waiting unduly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot think what you girls do all day long,”
he said sharply, when the door opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this Lorna replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, sir, if you please, the baby has come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that won’t alter the price of bacon,” ejaculated
Mr. Rendall, and pushed past her into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But notwithstanding this attitude of <span class='it'>nonchaloir</span>, he
was genuinely put about by the news. He did not admit
the right of babies to take liberties with their time-sheets.
To do so was an impertinent indiscretion. The
other two children had not behaved in this manner, and
he saw no reason why a special latitude should be extended
to the new arrival. Already he had made preparations
for being from home when this troublesome
period arrived, and now, by a caprice of nature, he was
involved in all the discomfort that falls to the lot of a
husband at such a time. It was not part of his nature
to take a secondary place in his own household, and he
esteemed that to do so was derogatory to his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Throwing his hat on the hall chair he entered the
drawing-room, where he received a rude surprise. It
was his habit, before setting out to the City, to finish his
breakfast coffee by the drawing-room fire. To his disgust
and irritation he found the empty cup, a crumpled
newspaper, and his soft slippers just as he had left them
that morning. Mightily angered, Mr. Rendall moved
toward the bell, when his eye fell upon a basket in the
grate. With the intention of throwing cup, newspaper,
shoes and basket into the garden, he crossed the room,
but as he stooped to carry out his resolve, a faint, flickering
wail came to his ears. The contents of the basket
moved ever so slightly—a fold of blanket turned outward,
and the thin, elfin face of his youngest son was
revealed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment the nurse came into the room. She
hesitated at the sight of Mr. Rendall, then stepped forward
with,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s you, sir. Hush, that’s the baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you imagine I thought it was a packet of envelopes?”
retorted Mr. Rendall. “But why not put
him in the nursery?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other children have only just been sent to their
aunt’s, sir, and the nursery isn’t quite ready. Poor
little thing’s very weakly, and has to be near a good
fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m,” said Mr. Rendall. “I see! Boy, eh? Not
much good—weakly boys!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but he’ll soon strengthen up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope so. Yes. Doctor’s bills—no good! Mrs.
Rendall all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going along very nicely, I’m glad to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m. Yes. When did all this happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About three o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not much of a chance to clear up, eh? Cups and
things lying about! Well, I suppose I may as well go
upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interview between husband and wife does not
affect our narrative and may well be omitted.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Despite adverse conditions, Wynne Rendall survived
the perils of infancy. He was, however, a fragile child,
susceptible to chills and fever, and ailments the flesh is
heir to. In appearance he in no way resembled his
brother or sister—healthy children both, with large appetites
and stupid, expressionless faces. He had a
broad brow, which overcast the slender lower portions
of his face and accentuated the narrowness of his
shoulders. His eyes were restless and very bright; they
flickered inquiry at every object which passed before
their focal plane. His attention was readily attracted
to anything unusual even in his early pram days. On
one occasion he saw a balloon floating over the houses
at a low altitude, and his perambulator never passed the
spot above which he had seen it, without his eyes lifting
toward the skies in anxious search. Wynne’s nurse was
a conscientious little being, and took a fierce pride in
the prowess of her charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way ’e notices, you know. Never forgets so
much as anything,” she would confide to other nurses
as they pursued their way toward the gardens. “Knows
’is own mind, ’e does, and isn’t afraid to let you know
it, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly Wynne held ideas regarding the proper
conduct of babies and did not hesitate to raise his voice
in displeasure when occasion demanded. In this, however,
he showed a logical disposition, for he never cried
for the sake of crying. Of toys he very soon tired, and
signified lack of interest by throwing them from his
pram at moments when his actions were unobserved.
As a rule he showed some enthusiasm with the arrival
of a new toy, and cherished it dearly for two or three
days, but directly the novelty had worn off he lost no
time in ridding himself of its society. If he were
caught in the act, and the toy restored to him, he would
cry very heartily, bite his hands, and kick his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike most children, his first adventures with talking
did not consist in repetition of the words “mummie”
and “daddy.” The nurse did her best to persuade him,
but he was obdurate, and declined to accept the view
that they should take precedence in forming a vocabulary.
Trees, sky and water he articulated, almost perfectly,
before bothering about nouns defining mere mortals.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the age of four and a half he was sent to a kindergarten,
where he found many things to wonder about.
He spent a year or more wondering. He wondered
about the ribbons that tied little girls’ hair, and why hair
need be tied, since it was pleasanter to look upon in riot.
He wondered why the lady who kept the school had a
chain to her eye-glasses, since they gripped her nose so
securely that the danger of their falling off was
negligible. He wondered why A was A, and not for
example S, and would not accept it as being so without
a reason being furnished. Also he wondered why he
should be set tasks involving the plaiting of coloured
strips of paper, which were tiresome to perform and unsightly
when finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why need I?” he asked petulantly. “Grown-ups
don’t. They are ugly and silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t say that, Wynne,” reproved the mistress.
“Besides it isn’t true. Doesn’t your mother do
pretty embroidery? I am sure she does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The logic of the reply pleased him, but it also set him
speculating why his mother devoted her time to such
profitless employment. The designs she worked were
stereotyped and geometrical. It seemed impossible any
one could wish to be associated with such productions,
and yet, when he came to reflect upon the matter, he
realized that most of her time was spent stitching at
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the first opportunity he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mummie, why do you do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it is pretty,” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There must be something wrong then, he decided.
Either she had used the wrong word, or the natural
forms which he had decided were “pretty” were not
pretty at all. The train of thought was a little complex,
so he questioned afresh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are they for when you’ve done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Antimacassars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s antercassars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means something you put over the back of a
chair to prevent the grease from people’s hair spoiling
the coverings.” Mrs. Rendall’s grandmother had provided
her with this valuable piece of knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes roamed round the precise semi-circle of small
drawing-room chairs, each complete with its detachable
antimacassar. As he looked it struck him that the
backs of these chairs were so low that no grown-up
person could bring his head into contact with them unless
he sat upon the floor. Wherefore it was clear that
his mother was making provision against a danger which
did not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this discovery awoke the impression that she
could hardly be a lady of sound intelligence. Rather
fearfully he advanced the theory that her labours were
in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t bother your head about these things,” said Mrs.
Rendall. “Plenty of time to think of them when you
are grown up.” And she threaded her needle with a
strand of crimson silk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne passed from the room disturbed by many
doubts. To the best of his ability he had proved to his
mother that antimacassars in no sense were antimacassars,
and, in defiance of his logic, she continued to produce
them. Moreover, she had said they were pretty,
and they were <span class='it'>not</span> pretty—she had said they were antimacassars
and they were <span class='it'>not</span> antimacassars. Could her
word, therefore, be relied upon in other matters? For
instance, when she announced at table, “You have had
quite enough;” or at night, “It is time to go to bed,”
might it not, in reality, be an occasion for a “second
helping” or another hour at play? It was reasonable
to suppose so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He decided it would be expedient to keep his eyes
open and watch the habits of grown-ups more closely in
the future.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The next serious impression on Wynne’s susceptible
brain was the discovery of routine, and he conceived for
it an instant dislike. To him it appeared a grievous
state of affairs that nearly all matters were guided by
the clock rather than by circumstance. One had one’s
breakfast not because one was hungry, but because it
was half-past eight, and so on with a mass of other details,
great and small, throughout the day. That people
should wilfully enslave themselves to a mere mechanical
contrivance, instead of rising superior to the calls of
time and place, was incomprehensible to Wynne. He
could not appreciate how regularity and repetition in
any sense benefited the individual. He observed how
a breakdown in the time-table of events was a sure signal
for high words from his father, and an aggravated sense
of calamity which ran through every department of the
house. True, a late breakfast presaged the loss of a
train, and so much time less at the office, but surely this
was no matter for melancholy? It argued a poor spirit
that could not rejoice at an extra quarter of an hour in
bed, or delaying the pursuit of irksome duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had never seen his father’s office, but at the
age of seven he had already formed very pronounced
and unfavourable views regarding it. To his mind the
office and the City were one—a place which swallowed
up mankind in the morning and disgorged them at
night. The process of digestion through which they appeared
to have passed produced characteristics of a distressing
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A child judges men by his father, and women by his
mother. From this standard Wynne judged that men
might be tolerable were it not for the City. The City
was responsible for his father’s ill-humours at night—the
city inspired home criticism and such observations
as:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I come back tired out and find——” etc.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had a very wholesome distaste for recurrent
sentiments; he liked people to say new things that were
interesting. The repetition of ready-made phrases was
lazy and dull—the very routine of speech. It were better,
surely, to say nothing at all than have catch-phrases
for ever on one’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this point his thoughts turned to inanimate objects,
and subconsciously he realized how routine affected
their arrangement as inevitably as it affected human
beings. Look where you would, there was always a hat-rack
in the hall, a church almanack in the lavatory, and
a clock on the dining-room mantelpiece. Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a certain rough justice in the position of
the hat-rack, assuming that one admitted the law which
discouraged the wearing of hats in the house, but why
should one desire to study saints’ days while washing
one’s hands? A clock, too, would be none the less serviceable
if standing on a cabinet. Who, then, was responsible
for dictating such laws? he asked himself.
Clearly these were matters for investigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An opportunity to investigate arose a few days later.
There was a new housemaid, and after her first effort
to turn out the drawing-room Mrs. Rendall summoned
her to explain that the chairs and tables had not been
put back in their proper places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your master would be most annoyed if he saw this,
Emily. It is very careless indeed. These chairs must
go like this”—and the old order was restored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do they have to go like that, Mummie?” demanded
Wynne, when the maid had departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they always have,” replied Mrs. Rendall,
with great finality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was too young to understand the meaning of a
vicious circle or he might have recognized its rotations
in her reply. So everything must be done again because
it has been done before. Seemingly that was the
law governing the universe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Speaking almost to himself he mused:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it would be nice to do things because they
<span class='it'>never</span> have been done before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To which Mrs. Rendall very promptly replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t silly,” said Wynne. “Why is it silly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you say another word you will go straight to
bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remark was as surely in place as the clock which
stood on the dead centre of the mantelpiece.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Middle class suburban prosperity was not the atmosphere
to produce the best results from Wynne Rendall’s
active, sensitive brain. He could not understand
his parents, and they did not attempt to understand him.
His elder brother and sister, being three and four years
his senior, left him outside their reckoning. They
played sedate games, in which he was never invited to
take part. To tell the truth, he had little enough inclination,
for most of their ideas of entertainment revolved
round commercial enterprise, which he cordially
disliked. His brother would build a shop with the
towel-horse, stock it with nursery rubbish, and sell the
goods, after much ill-humoured bartering, to his sister.
She, poor child, in spite of frequent importunities, never
once was allowed to play the rôle of shopkeeper, but
continued as a permanent customer until the game had
lost its relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Wynne was thrown very much on his own resources.
He read voraciously whatever books he could
procure, and spent a deal of time working out his own
intricate little thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere at the back of his head was a strong conviction
that the world held finer things than those surrounding
him. To strengthen this belief were certain
passages in the books he read. On the whole, however,
he was rather disappointed with reading. This in itself
was not surprising, in view of the quality of the books
to which he had access. It seemed to him that a man
might very easily devise more romantic imaginings than
any with which he had come into contact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To test the truth of this theory, he took a pencil
stump and some paper into the garden and tried to
write about pleasing things. But the words he desired
were hard to find, hard to spell, and difficult to string
together. So, instead, he decided to draw the little Princess
who was the heroine of his unwritten tale. In this
he was more successful and achieved a dainty little figure
with an agreeable smile. To some extent this
pleased him, but not altogether. He was painfully conscious
that her feet were clumsy, and her eyes ill drawn,
and that the picture did not express half he desired to
express. A picture was stationary, and lacked the
movement and variety of words. Words could describe
the picture, but the picture could not speak the words.
Thus his first artistic experiment was fraught with disappointment.
As luck would have it, his father chanced
by and flicked the paper from his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, eh?” he demanded. “Wasting your
time drawing! Why aren’t you at play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m ’musing myself,” replied Wynne, sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You amuse yourself with a ball, then, like anybody
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is curious how closely a ball is associated with
amusement. The average man is incapable of realizing
entertainment that does not include the use of a ball.
Reputations have been made and lost through ability or
inability to handle it in the proper manner. A man is
considered a very poor sort of fellow if he expresses disdain
and contempt for the ball. Conceive the catastrophic
consequences that would result if a law were passed
forbidding the manufacture of balls? A shudder runs
through the healthy-minded at the bare thought of
such a thing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall’s anger can readily be appreciated, then,
when his son made answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t any fun in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No fun?” roared Mr. Rendall. “Time you got some
proper ideas into your head, young fellow. Be ashamed
of yourself! Fetch a ball from the nursery at once, and
let me see you enjoying yourself with it, or you’ll hear
something. Understand this, too—there’s not going to
be any drawing in this household, or a lot of damn high-falutin
artistic business either. Get that into your
head as soon as you can. Be off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes later, in a white heat of fury, Wynne
was savagely kicking a silly woollen ball from one end
of the grass patch to the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not the way,” said his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the ball,” screamed Wynne, and made his
first acquaintance with a willow twig across the back.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is a matter for speculation as to what extent environment
can smother natural impulses. Surrounded
on all sides by convention and routine, the spark of
originality is in a fair way to become dampened or
altogether extinguished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the case with Wynne Rendall. He was half
confident that many existing ideals were not ideals at
all, and that much that was desirable to develop was
wilfully undeveloped; but weighing in the balance
against this view were the actions and opinions of those
with whom he came into contact. Was it, then, he who
was at fault? A glance to the right and left seemed
to point to that conclusion. And yet there was nature
to support his view: nature with its thousand intricate
moods of growth and illumination—nature who pranked
the water to laughing wavelets and tasselled the sky
with changing clouds—nature who made night a castle
of mystery where invisible kings held court, and mischievous
hobgoblins gobbled at the fairies’ toes as they
tripped it beneath the laurel bushes in the garden.
Surely, surely these things mattered more greatly than
half-past eight breakfast, and the 9:15 to town? Surely
there was greater happiness to be found thinking of
these than in flinging a ball at ninepins or kicking it
through a goal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet his father beat him because he drew a fairy,
and his mother threatened him with an early bed when
he desired to do as others had never done before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His brother and sister played at “shop,” and comforted
their parents exceedingly by so doing. They
never asked “silly questions,” he was constantly told.
They were all right, and only he was wrong.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is hard indeed to preserve faith with so great a
consensus of opinion against one, and it is probable
Wynne Rendall would have dulled into a very ordinary
lad had it not been for a chance visit from his father’s
brother. Wynne had often heard his parents speak of
Clem Rendall. They referred to him as a “ne’er-do-well,”
a term which Wynne took to imply a person who
did not go to the City in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Idle and good for nothing,” said his father—“never
do anything useful in this world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If by doing anything useful he implied the achievement
of business success his remarks were certainly
true, and yet there were features in Clementine Rendall
which called for and deserved a kindlier mention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was born, it will be remembered, at a time when
his father’s virility had to some extent abated. He was,
in a way, an old man’s child, free from all ambitions
toward personal advancement. Heredity had endowed
him with imagination, appreciation, a charming exterior,
a fascinating address, and an infinite capacity for doing
nothing. At the clubs—and he was a member of many—his
appearance was always greeted with enthusiasm.
Few men could claim a greater popularity with both
men and women, and his generosity was as unfailing as
his good humour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no real occasion for Clementine Rendall
to work, for he had inherited what little money his father
had to leave, and a comfortable fortune from his mother,
which he made no effort to enlarge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s father, who had not profited by the decease
of either of his parents, did not love his brother
Clementine any the better in consequence. He was a
man who liked money and desired it greatly. He was
fond of its appearance, its power, and the pleasing
sounds it gave when jingled in the pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the reading of the will there had been something
of a scene on account of a piece of posthumous
fun from the late Edward’s pen:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To my son Clementine I will and bequeath my
entire fortune and estate, real and personal.” And
written in pencil at the foot of the page—“To that
pillar of commerce, Robert Everett Rendall, who was
once my son, I bequeath a quarter of a pound of China
tea, to be chosen according to his taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on a bright Sunday morning that Clem
Rendall appeared at “The Cedars,” and his visit was entirely
unexpected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Morning,” he greeted the maid who opened the door.
“Family at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s father came out into the hall to see who the
visitor might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, Robert,” said Clem, “coming for a walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly ten years had elapsed since their last meeting,
and Mr. Rendall, senior, conceived that the tone of his
brother’s address lacked propriety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a surprise, Clem,” he observed, soberly
enough. His eyes travelled disapprovingly over his
brother’s loose tweed suit, yellow-spotted necktie, and
soft felt hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a lovely day, I took a train to Wimbledon and
determined to walk over to Richmond Park. Passing
your house reminded me. Are you coming?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t go for walks on Sunday, Clem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at this point that Wynne, who was coming
down the stairs, halted and noted with admiration and
surprise the bluff, hearty figure of the strange visitor,
who wore no gloves and carried no cane, and whose
clothes seemed to breathe contempt for Sabbatical traditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not? Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of us go to church on Sunday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you go because you want to go or because it’s
Sunday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s heart almost stopped beating. Those were
his feelings about half-past eight breakfast expressed in
words. Apparently Clem neither desired nor expected
a reply, for he put another question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s tea, Robert? ’Strordinary thing, here are
you—most respectable fellow living—deliberately supplying
a beverage that causes more scandal among its
consumers than any other in the world. Opium’s a joke
to it. Ever thought of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, and don’t intend to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha, well—it’s worth while. Hullo! Who’s this?”
His eye fell upon Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my younger son. Wynne—come along, my
boy—gaping there! Shake hands with your Uncle
Clementine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne did not require a second invitation, but descended
the stairs two at a time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Frail little devil, aren’t you?” said Clem, enveloping
the small hand of his nephew. “Jove! Robert, but
there’s a bit of the old man in him—notice it? Something
about the eyes—and mouth. How old are you,
youngster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m nine,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nine, eh! Fine age. Just beginning to break the
bud and feel the sun. Wish I were nine, and all to make.
Don’t you wish you were nine, Robert?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course you do. If you were breaking the bud at
nine you wouldn’t graft the stem with a tea-plant.
Would he, youngster? Not on purpose. He’d pitch it
a bit higher than that—see himself a larkspur or a
foxglove before he’d be satisfied. Well, what about this
walk? Bring the youngster too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think his mother has already arranged⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense! If you don’t care to come he and I’ll go
together. Get your hat, son.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in memory Wynne was grateful
for the hat-rack being in the hall. He snatched his cap
from a peg and ran into the front garden before his
father had time to say no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently Clem realized that an embargo would
in all probability be placed on the expedition, for he
only waited long enough to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect us when you see us,” and followed Wynne,
closing the front door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, youngster,” he ordered; “we must sprint
the first mile or they’ll put bloodhounds on our track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gripped Wynne’s hand and raced him down the
road. At the corner a fly was standing, with the driver
dozing upon the box.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jump in,” shouted Uncle Clem. Then “Drive like
the devil, Jehu. We’ve broken into the Bank of England
and Bow Street runners are after us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver was a cheerful soul, and he whipped up
the horse to a galumphing canter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was quite speechless from laughter and excitement.
When at last he recovered his voice it was
to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t told him where to go, Uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t be half such fun if we knew. Besides,
he’s a fellow with imagination—he knows what to do.
He’ll take us to a secret place in the heart of the country
where we can bury the treasure. I wouldn’t be a bit
surprised if he took us to Richmond Park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke loud enough for the driver to hear, and
was rewarded for his subtlety by an almost imperceptible
inclination of the shiny black hat, and the cab took a
sharp turn to the left along a road leading over the
common in the direction of Sheen Gate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem preserved the hunted attitude until they
had covered the best part of a mile; then he leant back
with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe we have shaken off our pursuers,” he declared,
“and can breathe easily once more. Hullo!”
pointing to the sky, “that’s a hawk—see him? Wonderful
fellows, hawks! Always up in the clouds rushing
through space, and only coming to earth to snatch at
a bit of food. That’s the right idea, y’know. Never
do any good if you stick to the ground all the while.
’Course he’s a nasty-tempered fellow, and a bit of a
buccaneer, but there’s a good deal to be said in favour
of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The look of admiration on Wynne’s face made him
smile and shake his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you are wrong in thinking that, youngster.
There’s nothing of the hawk about me. I lack the
energy that compels his headlong flights. One might
say that I was a bit of a lark, for I enjoy a flutter in
the blue, and I can’t help lifting a song of praise when
I get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne did not dare to open his lips, lest he should
stay the course of this wonderful being’s reflections.
It was almost too good to be true to find himself actually
in contact with some one who spoke with such glorious
enthusiasm and spirit about these delightful unearthly
matters, and whose conversation seemed to bear no relation
to time-tables and ordinary concerns of life. So
he nodded very gravely and edged a little nearer the
big man in the rough tweed suit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem understood the impulse, and slipped his
hand through his little nephew’s arm. He took possession
of Wynne’s hand and raised it in his palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of us have five fingers and five senses, and most
of us use none of them. Yes, most of us are like mussels
on a rock, who do no more than open their shells for
the tide to drift victuals into their mouths. That’s the
thing to avoid, y’know—molluscry. What are you going
to do with your five fingers and your five senses,
youngster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I don’t quite know what I will do with them,
Uncle,” Wynne replied, hesitatingly. Then, with more
assurance—“But I know what I shan’t do with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t do things because they always have been
done before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine laughed. “Not a bad beginning,” he
said; “but you want to be very sure of the alternative.
No good pushing over a house if you can’t build a better.
You didn’t know your grandfather—no end of a fine
fellow he was—used his brain and his hands to some
effect. He was an artist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, was he?” said Wynne, with a shade of disappointment.
He had never been told before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t that please you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, Uncle. I think it would be nice to
be an artist, but⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got some pictures at home, and they don’t
seem very nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, they wouldn’t. But there are all sorts of
pictures, and perhaps yours are the wrong sort. Now,
your grandfather painted the right sort. Here, wait
a minute.” He fumbled in his pocket and produced
a letter-case. “There!” taking a photograph from one
compartment. “This is a copy of one of his pictures.
Look at it. A faun playing his pipe to stupid villagers.
D’you see the expression on his face? He looks very
serious, doesn’t he, and yet you and I know that he’s
laughing. Can you guess why he’s laughing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne took the photograph and studied it carefully.
At length he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s laughing because they can’t understand the
tune he’s playing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bravo!” cried Uncle Clem, and clapped him on the
back. “Any more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne turned to the picture again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some of them aren’t paying attention. Look at
that one—he’s cutting a piece of stick to amuse himself.
And this—he looks just like his father does when he’s
wondering if he has time to catch the train.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, excellent! That’s precisely what he is doing.
If he had been born in a later age he’d have been looking
at his watch—as it is he is telling the time by the
sun—see it falling there between the trees?—and he
seems to be saying, ‘If this fellow goes on much longer
I shall miss my tea.’ Don’t you think that picture was
worth painting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Wynne; “but I’ve never seen a picture
like that before. Ours are all lighthouses and things.
What is the name of the man who is playing the pipe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a faun—or, as some people would say—a
satyr.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to be a faun,” said Wynne, “but if I were
I should get into a fearful temper with the people who
didn’t like my tunes. I should hit them over the head
with my pipe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d cease to be a satyr if you did that. To be a
proper satyr you must smile and go on playing until
at last they do understand. That’s the artist’s job
in this world, and it is a job too—a job and a fearful
responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because at heart the villagers don’t want to understand,
and if you feel it’s your duty to make them—your
duty to stir their souls with music—then you
must be doubly sure that you give them the right music.
A mistake in a row of figures doesn’t matter—any one
can alter that—but a false note of music—a false word
upon the page—a false brush-mark upon a canvas stands
for all time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” breathed Wynne. “I hadn’t thought of
that. I’d only thought it mattered to make people
believe something different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! We’re through the gates,” exclaimed
Uncle Clem. “Drive on somewhere near the ponds,
Jehu, and deposit us there. Ever been in the Royal
Park of Richmond before, young fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head. His mind did not switch over
to a new train of thought as rapidly as his uncle’s, and
it still hovered over the subject of the picture, which
he kept in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep it if you like,” said Uncle Clem, following
the train of his nephew’s thoughts. “Keep it and
think about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, may I really? It would be lovely if I might.”
His eyes feasted on his new possession. “Uncle, there
are two of the villagers who seem to understand, aren’t
there? These two, holding hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, to be sure they do. That’s because they are
lovers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lovers?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, lovers understand all manner of things that
other people don’t. In fact, only a lover can properly
understand. But I’ll tell you all about that later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later on” is so much kindlier a phrase than
“When you are old enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, put it in your pocket. What—afraid of
crumpling it? Half a minute, then; I’ll turn out the
letter-case and you can have that too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so Wynne came to possess a most marvellous
picture and a crocodile case, bearing in silver letters
“C. R.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” said Clem to the driver, as they descended
by the rhododendrons near the ponds, “it would be a
good idea if you drove to Kingston and bought us a
lunch. You know the sort of thing—meat pies, jam
tarts, ginger beer, fairy cakes—anything you can think
of. We’ll meet you here in an hour and a half.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the driver a five-pound note and smiled him
farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very splendid to be associated with a man
who would trust a stranger with so huge a fortune without
so much as taking the number of the cab. Wynne
could not help recalling the precautions his father had
taken when once he had despatched a messenger to
collect a parcel from the chemist’s. The comparison
was greatly to the detriment of Mr. Rendall, senior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is one of the wildest parts of the park,” announced
Uncle Clem. “If we go hushily we shall see
rabbits before they see us, and perhaps almost get within
touch of a deer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, real deer—stags?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any amount of them. They bell in the mating
season, and have battles royal on the mossy sward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you get near enough to touch one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not quite. You think you will, and tiptoe toward
him with your hand outstretched, and then, just as you
almost feel the warmth of him at the tips of your fingers—hey
presto! Zing! he’s gone, and divots of earth are
flying round your ears. That’s why the stag is the
ideal beast—because he’s elusive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You could shoot him,” suggested Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you can kill an ideal, and a lot of good may
it do you dead. Shooting is no good, but if you run
after him, as like as not he’ll lead you through lovely,
unheard-of places. Here’s an umbrageous oak. We’ll
spread ourselves out beneath it and praise God for the
sunshine that makes us appreciate the shade.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw himself luxuriously on the soft green
carpet, and felt in his pocket for a pipe. It was not
until he had carefully filled it that he found he had no
matches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” he said, “is really terrible. What is to be
done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll run off and find some one,” exclaimed Wynne,
enthusiastic at the chance of rendering a service. But
Uncle Clem restrained him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no,” he said, “we must think of more ingenious
methods than that. You and I are alone on a desert
island, but we possess a watch. Casting our eyes
around we discover a rotten bough. Look!” He broke
a little fallen branch that lay in the grass beside his
hand. “The inside you see is mere tinder. Now we
will roll out into the sun and operate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was some while before the concentrated ray from
the watch-glass produced a spark upon the wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blow for all you are worth,” cried Uncle Clem.
“Splendid—it is beginning to catch! Oh! blow again,
Friday—see it smoulders! One more blow—a gale this
time. Oh, excellent Man Friday!—what a lucky fellow
Robinson Crusoe is!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dropped the ember into his pipe and sucked
furiously. At last tiny puffs of rewarding smoke began
to emerge from his lips. His features relaxed and he
grinned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have conquered,” he declared—“earned the reward
for our labours! But the odd thing is that now
the pipe is alight I am not at all sure if I really want
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every boy must possess a hero—it is the lodestar of
his being. He can lie awake at night, happy in the
mere reflection of that wonderful being’s prowess. In
imagination, enemies, one by one, are arraigned before
the protecting hero, who, with the justice of gods admixed
with a finely-tempered satire, judges their sins
and sends them forth repentant. But this is not all.
He can lift the soul to empiric heights, and open at a
touch new and wonderful doors of thought and action.
He can enthuse, inspire, illumine, refresh old ideals—inspirit
new—make dark become light, and light so
brilliant that the eyes are dazzled by the whiteness
thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hero occurs by circumstance or deed, and his
responsibility is boundless. He must think as a king
thinks when the eyes of the nation rest upon him—he
must tread all ways with a sure foot and proud bearing—chest
out and head high. He must not slip upon
the peel that lies in the highway, nor turn aside to
escape its menace; he must crush it beneath his heel
as he strides along, a smile upon his lips, his cane swinging—the
veriest picture of majesty and resource.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall found his hero that Sunday in Richmond
Park, and worshipped him with the intense devotion
of which only a boy is capable. God, he conceived,
must have had some very personal handiwork in the
fashioning of Uncle Clem. He saw him as a man
possessed of every possible charm and virtue, without
one single unpleasing factor to offset them. It is not
unnatural, therefore, that Wynne should have fallen
down and worshipped, and not unnatural that there
should have been a dry ache in his throat as, in the
lavender twilight, the cab turned the corner of their
street and slackened speed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s say good-night outside, Uncle,” he suggested,
huskily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps he hoped his uncle would give him a kiss,
but Clementine had something far better in store. He
threw an arm round the narrow little shoulders and
gave Wynne a combined pat and hug. The broad comradeship
of the action was fine—magnificent. Pals
both! One good man to another! it seemed to say.
Stanley and Livingstone must have met and parted in
suchwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A capital day,” said Uncle Clem. “We must repeat
it—you and I. Better wait, Jehu, for I shan’t be
long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The atmosphere of the drawing-room struck a chill
as they entered. From the reserve displayed it was
clear that Wynne’s parents had been discussing the
expedition adversely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and change your boots, Wynne,” said his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a cold welcome, he reflected, as he departed in
obedience to the command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a good boy,” remarked Uncle Clem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he will prove so,” said Mr. Rendall, devoutly,
as befitted a Sunday evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rendall said nothing. She had nothing to say.
Granted the necessary degree of courage she would have
been glad to ask Clem to change his boots, but circumstances
being as they were she was denied the privilege,
and kept silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there’s a lot in him. You’ll have to go to work
pretty carefully to bring it out. A rare bulb with delicate
shoots. Touch ’em the wrong way and they’ll
wither, but with the right amount of nursing and the
right degree of temperature there are illimitable possibilities.
Interesting thing education!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” concurred Mr. Rendall. “A sound business
education fits a boy for after life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Business! H’m! Think he suggests a likely subject
for business, Robert? I fancy, when the time
comes, the boy’s bent may lie in other directions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy will do as he is told, Clem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem smiled, looked at the ceiling, and shook his
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which of us do?” he said. “Never even the likely
ones. You may bend a twig, but it springs straight
again when your hand is removed. Seems to me our
first duty toward our children is to encourage their
mental direction and not deflect it. Don’t you agree,
Mrs. Rendall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” replied that lady, with her inevitable
falling inflection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you don’t,” snapped her husband, “so why say
you do? No reason at all! In the matter of educating
children, Clem, I cannot see you are qualified to
hold an opinion. The first duty of a parent is to instil
in the child a sense of duty to its parent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, bosh!” said Clem, pleasantly. “Absolute bosh.
Respect and duty are not a matter of convention or of
heredity, they must be inspired.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are not likely to agree, so why proceed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If we only proceeded on lines of agreement we
should come to an immediate standstill. Let’s thrash
out the matter. To my thinking, the father should respect
the child more than the child should respect the
father. It must be so. The poor little devil comes into
the world through no impulse of its own. It had no
choice in the matter. Its coming is impressed—it is
conscripted into being—that’s indisputable. Then,
surely to goodness, it is up to us to give it, as it were,
the Freedom of the City—the freedom of the fields, and
every possible latitude for expansion and self-expression.
To do less were an intolerable injustice. Our
only excuse for producing life is that we may admire its
beauty—not that it may admire ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is wild talk,” began Mr. Rendall. But Clem
was too advanced to heed interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most degrading thing you can hear a man say
to his child is, ‘After all I’ve done for you.’ It should
be, ‘Have I done enough for you? Have I made good?’
That is the straightforward attitude; but to bring a
child into the world against its will and to force it along
lines that lead away from its own inclination is
dastardly.” He turned suddenly to Mrs. Rendall.
“It must be so wonderful to be a mother, so glorious to
have accepted that mighty responsibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rendall fumbled at the threading of her silk
and dropped her scissors to the floor. As he stooped
to pick them up Clem continued:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To know that within oneself there lies the power to
fashion a body for those tiny souls that flicker out there
in the beyond.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Clem!” Mr. Rendall tapped his foot warningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, Robert, we know nothing of these matters—they
are beyond our ken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A very good reason for not discussing them. The
subject seems to be rather⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Distasteful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it? Good God! And yet we discuss our colds
in the most polite society, and bear witness to their
intensity by quoting the number of handkerchiefs we’ve
used. We have no shame in trumpeting our petty
thoughts of the day, but that faint bugle-call that sounds
in the night and summons us⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think supper is waiting,” said Mrs. Rendall, rising
to her feet. “I suppose you will be staying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Delighted,” said Clem, affably. “And I’ll bring
the bugle-call with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I trust you won’t forget that servants will be in
the room,” remarked Mr. Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can send ’em out to ask my cabby to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem did not delay his departure over long. His
conversational tide was somewhat dammed by the cold
mutton and cold potatoes that formed the basis of his
brother’s hospitality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He allowed Mr. Rendall to do the talking, and was
oppressed by a great pity for his little nephew, who
had to listen to such irritable and melancholy matter
at every meal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace and Eva, the two elder children, behaved
with precision and did not open their lips, save for the
reception of food. Wynne was discouraged on the few
occasions he spoke, and was the recipient of injunctions
not to “crumble his bread,” and to “sit up properly.”
These recurred with a clockwork regularity that deprived
them of the essence of command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result was to make Clem feel very dejected and
forlorn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said good-bye on the doorstep and walked, alone
as he thought, to the front gate. Arrived there he said
in a very heartfelt manner:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! What a night!” and was not a little taken
aback when his brother, who had followed, in soft
shoes, demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem recovered himself a little too intensely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All these damn stars,” he replied, with a broad gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m!” said Mr. Rendall. Then: “I hope you
haven’t been putting ideas into that boy’s head, Clem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are there already,” came the response. “Take
care of them, Robert.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He jumped into the cab and drove away.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A fall of rain and a little sunshine make a magic
difference to a garden bed. The petals of flowers unfold—colours
clear and intensify—white buds glisten
beneath their tight-drawn casings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can do with a lot of this,” the flowers seemed
to say. “Treat us aright and there is no limit to our
beauty and fragrance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But our English climate is not always amenable.
Sometimes it replies through the mouth of a nipping
norther, or by the hard, white hands of frost, and down
go the flowers, one by one, till only the sturdiest remain
standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would be no exaggeration to say that Wynne
Rendall’s soul had been opened out, in that one day
with his uncle, from forty-five to ninety degrees. So
many things he had doubted had been made sure, and
so many fears had been swept aside, to be replaced by
finer understandings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through Uncle Clem the world had become a new
place for him. It was no longer a public park, with
railings and finger-boards pointing the directions in
which one might or might not proceed. He did not
quite know what sort of place it had become, but he
was radiantly confident of glorious possibilities. Clearly
it would be the duty of all who had eyes to see, and
ears to hear, to perform something in praise of this
marvellous planet, and the wonderful people (<span class='it'>vide</span>
Uncle Clem) who walked upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He, Wynne, would do something—he felt the immediate
need to do something—he would do something
great. People, beholding what he had done, would exclaim,
“This is marvellous! Why have we not been
shown these wonders before?” Then they would feel
for him the same admiration he felt for Uncle Clem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the midst of these rapturous reflections came the
thought that perhaps he was a little young to become
the leader of a new movement. This, however, in no
wise oppressed him. The younger the better. The distillations
of his soul would be none the less rare for
being contained in a small vessel. He would play upon
a pipe to foolish villagers. There were foolish villagers
around him in abundance. He knew of two in their
own kitchen—hide-bound creatures who excused themselves
from doing anything he asked on the grounds of
suffering from “bones in their legs.” Were there not
others, beside, with whom he sat daily at table?
Charity should begin at home (there was a motto to
that effect hanging on the wall in the spare bedroom),
it should therefore begin with the lowest storey and
work up to the highest. These people were of proven
folly—that much he knew from personal investigation;
it was his duty to pipe them to a better understanding.
And then arrived a really disturbing thought. He
possessed no pipe, nor any skill to play upon it had he
possessed one. From exaltation his spirits fell to despair.
Was the world to be denied enlightenment for so
poor a reason? Such a pass would be unendurable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall was nothing if not courageous. If he
felt an impulse of sufficient force he would accept any
hazard to give it expression. His bodily frailty and
susceptibility to pain were no deterrents. He decided,
therefore, while the spirit moved him the supreme moment
must not be lost. He would have to rely upon
circumstance and the fertility of his imagination in
carrying out the campaign, and not allow his thoughts to
be damped by knowledge of their unpreparedness. He
recalled how yesterday the sweet environment had lent
colour to much that his uncle had said, and reflected it
would be well to profit by that lesson, and set the scene
for his new teachings in a fashion calculated to promote
a sympathetic atmosphere. To speak to his parents
of a freer life and purer outlook in their drawing-room,
as they had arranged it, would be to court failure.
His father was at the City, his mother was out—this,
then, was the ideal moment to strike a blow against
symmetry and in favour of æsthetics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With heart sledge-hammering against his ribs, Wynne
descended the stairs and entered the drawing-room.
With disfavour his eyes roamed over the accustomed
arrangements. Balance was the inspiring motive which
had dominated the Rendalls’ mind when they set out
their ornaments and hung their pictures, and balance
was the motive which Wynne determined to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beginning with his old enemy, the mantelpiece, he
cleared everything from it. None of these detested
examples of art should remain, he decided. The marble
clock, ticking menacingly, was crammed into the cabinet,
where it was speedily followed by the equestrian bronzes
and the wrought-iron candlesticks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne gasped with ecstasy as he viewed the straight
marble line denuded of these ancient eyesores. He had
decided that this should be the abiding place for a china
bowl containing tulips, a flat silver box and some books.
They should repose there in natural positions as though
set down by a thoughtless hand. He tried the effect,
and was disappointed; it lacked the spirit of negligé he
had designed. Then came an inspiration—of course, it
looked wrong because of the mirrors of the overmantel.
These immoral reflectors were at the desperate work of
duplication, and were forcing symmetry and balance
despite his precautions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This being the case, but one course of action was
open—the overmantel would have to go. It was a
massive affair, securely fastened to the wall with large
brass-headed nails, and Wynne was a very small person
to undertake its removal. To his credit it stands that
he did not wilt before the task. He climbed upon a
table and shook it to and fro until the nails worked loose,
then, exerting all his strength he heaved mightily. For
awhile it defied his efforts, but just as he was beginning
to despair the plaster gave way and the mighty mass of
wood and mirrors tilted forward. Nothing but the presence
of two little legs in front which supported a pair of
flimsy shelves prevented Wynne from being telescoped
in the subsequent collapse. He had just time to spring
to the floor and hand it off as the legs broke and the
whole affair slithered to the hearthrug. The fine swept
top broke like a carrot, and two of the side mirrors
cracked from end to end. Wynne lay under the debris
breathing very hard, and wondering if the crash had
been loud enough to reach the ears of the servants
below. Fortunately for him the kitchen was at the
other end of the house, and there came no rush of feet
from that direction. He waited a few terribly anxious
moments, then crawled out and surveyed his handiwork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No great revolution appears at its best in the initial
stages, and certainly this was a case in point. Balance
he had destroyed beyond all dispute, but in its place
had arisen chaos. Large patches of plaster littered
the carpet, and the grate was filled with pieces of wood
and wreckage. Where once the overmantel had covered
its surface, the wallpaper, in contradistinction to the
faded colours surrounding, showed bright and new.
It seemed as though the spook of the detestable affair
still haunted the spot, and would continue to do so down
all the ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that moment of extreme desolation Wynne experienced
the sensations which possess a pioneer when
he doubts if he has the strength to cross the ranges.
He had, however, already committed himself too deeply
to hang back, and so, with feverish energy, he began to
drag the remains into a corner of the room. As he did
so he overset an occasional table bearing a potted fern
and some china knick-knacks, all of which were smashed
to atoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With this calamity Wynne Rendall lost control of
himself. The mainspring of his idea snapped, and he
became merely a whirlwind of senseless activity. He
dragged pictures from the walls and thrust them beneath
tables, he wrenched the green plush curtains from the
lacquered pole and cast them anyhow—over chairs and
sofas—the straight-laid rugs he pulled askew, he flung
an armful of books haphazard on the top of the piano—he
set fire to the crinkly paper in the grate and threw
two aspidistras into the garden. An insane humour
seizing him, he brought in the hat-rack from the hall,
and hung coloured plates on all its pegs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the end of an hour the effect he had produced
could have been more simply arrived at, and with less
destruction to property, if some expert from Barcelona
had exploded a bomb in the apartment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s clothing was awry, his fingers cut and
bleeding, and his face covered with dust and perspiration,
when his father, followed by his mother, opened
the door and stood spellbound upon the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With eyes glittering like diamonds he turned and
faced them. The long pause before any word was
spoken was the hardest persecution he had to bear.
Then came the inevitable:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means—” he began, but the words stuck in his
throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you responsible for this?” Mr. Rendall took
a step toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne nodded. “Yes-s,” he breathed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he mad?” Mr. Rendall appealed to his wife, but
she was too flabbergasted to utter a sound. “Are you
mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Wynne. He knew he must speak. His
whole being called on him to speak, and yet, try as he
would, the words refused to come. Oh, why, why
wasn’t Uncle Clem present to say the things he could not
express? If he failed to establish his position there and
then the chance would be gone for ever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better speak,” said his father, “better explain
the meaning of this—and explain quick.” The
last part of the sentence rose to a shout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did it—I did it because you are all wrong—that’s
why—all wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wrong! What about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, everything. It’s—y-you can see, now, you were
wr-wrong—c-can’t you? Now that I’ve—oh, you were
so wrong⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There won’t be much wrong with what I intend
doing to you, my boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hand fell heavily on his shoulder, but he did not
wince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t make any difference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Clem said they didn’t want to understand—but
you just have to make them understand, and
go on until they do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he? Well, you’re on the point of understanding
something you’ve never properly appreciated before.
Out of the way, Mary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall selected a cane from the umbrella stand,
as he thrust Wynne down the hall to the dining-room.
Over the arm of the leather saddlebag chair he bent the
supple little body, and in the course of the half minute
which followed he performed an ancient ritual which
even Mr. Squeers would have found it difficult to improve
upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When it was over he threw the cane upon the table
and folded his hands behind his back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had enough?” he interrogated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The poor little faun twisted and straightened himself.
His face was paper-white, and his breath came
short and gasping, one of his hands fumbled on the
chair-back for support, and his head worked from side
to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a man Mr. Rendall found the sight unpleasant
to look upon, but as a father he felt the need to carry
the matter through to its lawful conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ve had enough say you are sorry. I want
no explanations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne forced himself to concentrate his thoughts
away from bodily anguish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve had enough—but it doesn’t mean that I’m
sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silence!” roared his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sorry—not a bit sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you intend to do this kind of thing again, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I shan’t do it again—not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get out of the room—get to bed at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem knew. The villagers do not want to
understand. Wynne groped his way from the room
and up the stairs. The world was not such a wonderful
place after all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Mrs. Rendall had been taking an inventory
of the disaster in the drawing-room. She sought
her husband with details of the result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The overmantel is quite ruined,” she announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the overmantel!” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did Wynne say he was sorry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry—no—he’s not sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I cannot think what he did it for,” she remarked
illogically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t talk like a fool,” he implored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two of the aspidistras have been thrown into the
garden,” said she.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Actions resulting from mental suggestion are sometimes
immediate. Mr. Rendall caught up the sugar-castor
and sent it hurtling through the air, and once
more “Clovelly” faced the world without a glass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear!” lamented Mrs. Rendall, “there seems
such a lot of smashing going on today, one can’t keep
pace with it all.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Next morning found Wynne ill and feverish. The
mental excitement and bodily pain of the previous
day had proved more than his constitution could endure.
Wherefore he tossed in bed, lying chiefly on his
side for obvious reasons. Mr. Rendall was thorough, of
that there was no question. Wynne was able to reassure
himself of his father’s thoroughness when he
touched his small flank with tentative finger-tips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the fever burnt within him he felt mightily sorry
for himself. The world had used him hardly when he
sought to offer rare and wonderful gifts. That this
should be so was a great tragedy—and a great mystery—also
it was infinitely sad. The sadness appealed to
him most, and he wept. He wept very copiously and
for a long time. The weeping was a pleasant relief and
a compensation for misery. He felt, if the world could
behold his tears, they would assemble about his bedside
and realize the injustice wrought by their deafness and
stupidity—they would be compassionate and anxious
to atone. Then, maybe, the great god of expression
would provide him with the words to make his meaning
clear. With this conviction he wept the louder, hoping
to attract attention, but none came nigh him. Accordingly
he wept afresh, and this time from disappointment.
In the midst of this final mood of tears his
brother, Wallace, came into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace had been privileged to see the state of the
drawing-room, and although he knew Wynne’s features
well enough, he felt the need to scrutinize afresh the
appearance of one who had wilfully produced such
havoc. The characteristic is common to humanity—a
man’s deeds create a revival of interest in his externals,
hence the success of Madame Tussaud’s and the halfpenny
illustrated press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the sight of his brother, Wynne stopped crying,
and composed himself to the best of his ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace found some difficulty in replying. No one
cares to admit they are visiting the Chamber of Horrors
for pleasure, although that is the true explanation of
their presence. At length he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up—” and added in support of his command,
“you silly fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t stare at me if I’m a silly fool,” said
Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cat may look at a king,” was Wallace’s considered
retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d rather a cat looked at me than you did,”
said Wynne, feeling he had nearly brought off something
very telling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace’s intention had not been to excite an argument
on reciprocal lines. He desired to get at his brother’s
reasons for the wholesale smash-up downstairs, consequently
he allowed the remark to pass unchallenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you break the overmantel and all those
vases?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because they were beastly and ugly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly and ugly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, horrid—and there were <span class='it'>two</span> of each of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace began to feel out of his depth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they were in <span class='it'>the drawing-room</span>,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the drawing-room in every house is, or should
be, the abode of art, it was obviously absurd to say that
the appointments thereof were beastly or ugly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne did not answer, so Wallace fell back on his
beginnings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>must</span> be a fool. Father gave you a good hiding,
didn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did it hurt?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never had a hiding.” There was rich pride
in the avowal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve never done anything worth getting one for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t I? ’Tany rate, I bet you don’t behave
like this again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bet I do,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you?” exclaimed Wallace, conscious of
great excitement, and hoping that on the next occasion
he might be privileged to witness the work of destruction
in full swing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace hesitated. “What room will you smash up
next time?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it isn’t for that,” cried Wynne, “you can’t
see—nobody understands⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then shut up,” said Wallace, and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange as it may seem, this interview had great
results in moulding Wynne Rendall’s character. From
his brother’s obvious inability to realize any motive in
his action, other than a wilful desire to destroy, he
turned to an active consideration of what his motives
had been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was this message he had wished to convey to
the world, and had stumbled so hopelessly in endeavouring
to express? It was the first time he had put the question
directly to himself. He knew he had had a quarrel
with many existing matters, but in what manner did
he propose to better them? And the answer came that
he did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had committed the very error against which Uncle
Clem had warned him—the error of breaking down an
old régime before he was able to supply an agreeable
alternative. Small wonder, then, if his actions had
savoured of lunacy to those who had beheld them. In
imagination he pictured the drawing-room as it appeared
after he had dealt with it, and was bound to confess that
his labours had rendered no service to the shrine of
comfort, art or beauty. Had he himself come suddenly
upon such a room he would have been disgusted by its
foolish and wanton disorder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The revolution had been a failure—complete and
utter. Sobriety had been dragged from his throne, and
havoc and ruin reigned instead. Havoc and Ruin—deplorable
monarchs both, of senseless countenance and
destructive hands. Small wonder if their subjects struck
at them with sticks and staves. Small wonder if they
could not see the ideals that lay hidden behind the
wreckage of the great upheaval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact stood out clearly that his talents were not
ripe. The time had not come when his song should
thrill the world. But come it should, some day. To
that end all his energies should be conserved. Yes, he
would make the world a listener, but he would give
it full measure for its attention, and even though each
note should cut them as a knife—it should not be the
gross stab of a maniac lurking in a dark doorway,
but as the cut of a surgeon’s scalpel, who cuts to cure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne sat up in bed, although to do so caused him
pain, and registered a vow that he would learn all there
was to learn, whereby in the end he might teach the
more.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span><h1>PART TWO<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PURPLE PATCH</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A man with a call is a very estimable fellow, but
is apt to prove tiresome to his companions.
The same might truthfully be said to apply to
a child, although cases of a call in a child’s disposition
are fortunately not of very frequent occurrence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this one excess Wynne’s behaviour provided
his parents with little reason for complaint. He developed
a strange amenity to domestic discipline—he
went to bed when he was told, and did not pursue
his old habits of asking “stupid questions.” But there
was about him a certain secretiveness at once perplexing
and irritating. He obeyed readily, and accepted correction
in good part, but there hovered round the corners
of his mouth a queer and cynical smile. His expression
seemed to say, “You are in command, and what you
say I must do I will do, but of course your rulings are
quite absurd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall endured this inexplicable attitude for
several months, but finally was so annoyed that he wrote
the master of the day-school of which Wynne was a
member, and asked him to investigate the matter and
inflict what punishments might seem adequate. To this
letter he received a reply to the effect that as Wynne
was showing such astonishing diligence at his books he
deemed it advisable to ignore an offence which, at
most, was somewhat hypothetical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall was by no means satisfied of the advisability
of taking so lenient a course. He considered it
pointed to a lack of authority which might well prove
fatal in the moulding of character. He decided, therefore,
to tackle Wynne himself upon the subject, and did
so in his accustomed style.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was working at Latin declensions in the morning-room
when his father entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proper time for everything,” he said. “Put away
that book and go out for a walk—plenty of time for book
reading in school hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Wynne, with resignation. As he
walked toward the door the smile curled the corners of
his mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! come back,” ordered Mr. Rendall. “Now
then what are you smiling at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne thought for a moment, then he answered,
“I shan’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you won’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I obey what you tell me to do, and without
any fuss, but I shan’t tell you why I smile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll see about that. P’r’aps I can find a way to
stop it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho! couldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, because I couldn’t stop it myself,” said Wynne,
and walked from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had learnt the value of a Parthian arrow. To
remain after the discharge of a shaft was to court painful
consequences. It was therefore his habit, after once
unmasking his batteries, to withdraw them speedily to
new emplacements. This was not cowardice, but diplomacy,
for there was no value in risking chastisement
which might be avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief point of difference between Wynne and his
father was that, whereas Wynne only cared to inquire
into matters of which he had no knowledge, Mr. Rendall
resented inquiring into concerns of which he was not
already thoroughly conversant. A man, woman or child
whose thoughts ran on different lines to his own became
automatically perverse and troublesome—a person to
avoid where possible, or, if impossible, to be forcibly
cowed into subservience to his rulings. As in America
a Standard automobile is forced upon the public, so in
his own home Mr. Rendall strove to standardize mental
outlook and opinion. Hitherto, at the expenditure of
a very slight amount of authority, his efforts had been
rewarded with some success, but in Wynne he perceived
the task was one which bade fair to stretch his patience
to the breaking point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne obeyed his rulings with submission, but it was
clearly evident his acceptance of them was purely superficial.
In no case was it apparent that his son was
satisfied either of their justice or value. Such a state
of affairs was intolerable. Thoughts of it invaded the
privacy of his mind during the sacred hours spent at
the City. Something would have to be done—stringent
reforms—penalties—hours spent in the bedroom—bread
and water. These and many other corrective measures
occurred to Mr. Rendall as he sat behind his paper in the
suburban train. And yet the whole thing was a confounded
nuisance. He didn’t want to be bothered—that
was the truth of the matter. Life had come to a pretty
pass if, after fifteen years of comparative matrimonial
quietude, a man had to worry his head about the conduct
of the people who dwelt beneath his roof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Mr. Rendall compiled a dictionary some of his
definitions would have been as under:⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Home.</span>—A point of departure and return, costing more
in upkeep than it should. A place for the exercise of
criticism—a place from which a man draws his views
on the injustice of local taxation—a spot where a man
desires a little peace and doesn’t get it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Wife.</span>—A person who is always a trifle disappointing—a
woman who does not understand the value of
money—a woman who asks silly questions about meals
and fails to provide the dishes a man naturally desires.
Some one who may be trusted to say the wrong
thing, who lacks proper authority over the servants
and children, and who does not appreciate all that has
been done for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Child.</span>—A being who makes a noise about the house,
the proper recipient of corrections, the abiding place
of “don’ts.” A being who occasionally accompanies
a man for a short walk, and is precluded from doing
so again on account of ill-behaviour. A creature with
irritating habits, unlikely to repay all that has been
spent upon it in doctor’s bills and education.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These instances should give a clearer understanding
of Mr. Rendall’s outlook. They may serve also to
enlist our sympathies on his behalf in the unhappy
possession of such a son as Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall conceived that a subject that could not
be understood should be immediately dismissed, and
he applied the same theory to human beings. Taking
this into consideration it is surprising that he did not
pack Wynne off to a boarding-school and so rid himself
of the source of his irritation. But Mr. Rendall,
however, was not prepared to take risks where money
was concerned. Rather than squander large sums upon
education, the benefits of which his son might prove
too young to appreciate, he determined that his own
convenience must be sacrificed. He seriously considered
the idea of sending Wynne to a cheaper school than
Wyckley, but abandoned the project as being too hazardous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wyckley was not a first-class school, but it had the
reputation of providing boys with an excellent business
education. To send Wynne to a cheaper might result
in equipping him less well to earn his own livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He therefore endured the inconvenience of Wynne’s
society until he had celebrated his twelfth birthday, and
then with a feeling of consummate relief dispatched
him to Wyckley complete with an ironbound wooden
box and a deplorably weak constitution.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the day before Wynne’s departure Clementine
Rendall paid a surprise visit. Wynne had not seen him
since the day in Richmond Park, three years before,
for his parents had discouraged their intimacy, but
Uncle Clem still lived in his mind as a very romantic
figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had been buying some of the kit required
for his school equipment, and on his return he found
his father and Uncle Clem in the morning-room. His
heart leapt at the sight of the big man, still splendid
as of yore, but the three years of suppression through
which he had passed had chilled the old impulse of
enthusiasm which had brought him down the stairs
three at a time on their first meeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo, youngster!” came the cheery voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Uncle Clem,” said Wynne, extending
his thin white hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks ill!” observed Clem to his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall raised his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Boy’s disposition is unhealthy,” he remarked,
“which naturally reacts on his physique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem flashed a glance from the speaker to the subject,
and noted how the corners of Wynne’s mouth curled
down as much as to say, “You see what I am up
against.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re hard to please. Boy’s all right! Aren’t
you, youngster?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The boy is far from all right, Clem. He appears to
lead a double life with some private joke of his own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll ask him,” said Clem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What father says is true. I have a private joke,
uncle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then get it off your chest, youngster. A joke is
like a drink, and must not be taken alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne pondered awhile before replying, then he
produced his first epigram.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you can’t share a drink with a teetotaler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The subtlety of the phrase pleased him inordinately,
and he was surprised to see that it produced nothing
but a frown from Uncle Clem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Robert, the youngster and I will take a turn in the
garden.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall demurred, but Clem waved the objection
aside and led the way down the openwork iron
stairs to the lawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then,” he said. “What’s the trouble with
you? Didn’t like that calculating remark of yours
one bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Wynne, “but why should I tell
them my joke, they couldn’t see it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then keep it for the dark, old fellow, or conceal
it altogether. The I-know-more-than-you-but-I-won’t-say-what-it-is
attitude does no one any good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne jerked his head petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The faun was laughing in grandfather’s painting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oho! So that’s it? But the villagers didn’t know
he was laughing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. But we shouldn’t be so unsubtle as to tell
them so. Consider a minute. Suppose we thought lots
of people were very wrong, and their wrongness tickled
our humour, d’you think the best way of putting ’em
right would be to laugh at ’em? Take it from me it
isn’t. If you laugh at a dog he’ll bite you, but pat
him and, in time, he’ll jump through hoops, walk on his
hind legs, and be tricksy as you want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They always frown at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe they wouldn’t if you didn’t smile at them.
Just what is it you are trying to get at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I don’t know yet—but some day I shall, and
then won’t I let them have it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed his mouth tight, and there was a fierce
resolve in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then here’s a bit of advice for you. Don’t start
quarrelling with the world you hope to reform. Remember
other people must build the pulpit you hope
to preach from. If you get their backs up before
you’ve learnt your sermon no one but yourself will ever
hear it. Lie low and gather all you can from the plains
before you seek the Purple Patch on the hill top.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Purple Patch,” repeated Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Every artist builds his tower on a Purple
Patch, and in his early working days he sees it shining
gloriously through the morning mists. There is honey
heather there, larkspur and crimson asters, and all the
air is brittle with new-born, virgin thoughts. I tell
you, old son, that purple patch is worth making for,
and it’s good to reflect when you have got there that
you came by a gentleman’s way. There are some may
call it Success, but I like the Purple Patch better. Success
may be achieved at such a dirty price and the
climber’s boots may be fouled with trodden flesh. Stick
to the Purple Patch, Wynne, and you’ll be a man before
you become a ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before taking his leave Clem gave Wynne a five-pound
note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a sad thing,” he said, “but a new boy with
a five-pound note is far more popular at school than
one without. If I were you I should blow a part of it
at the tuck-shop and do your pals a midnight feast.”
Privately he remarked to Mr. Rendall, “That boy is
woefully fragile. I have some doubt as to whether you
are wise in sending him to a boarding school. You
should drop the headmaster a line saying he’ll want
special care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already done so,” remarked Mr. Rendall,
with a somewhat sardonic smile. “If you are passing
the box you might post a letter for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem took the letter and said good-bye. He was
about to drop it in the pillar-box when a curious doubt
assailed him. Therefore, although to do so was entirely
foreign to his nature, he broke the seal and scanned the
contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, Robert,” he observed to himself, “most emphatically
not. We’ll give the boy a fair chance by
your leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And accordingly he posted the letter, torn in many
pieces, through the grating of a convenient sewer.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne arrived at Wyckley in all the rush and turmoil
of a new term. The boys had so many confidences
to impart regarding their holiday exploits, that his
presence was not observed until after tea. Consequently
he had leisure to dispose his belongings and take a walk
round the schoolrooms and playgrounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What he saw was new and interesting. The high
bookcases, crammed with scholastic literature, impressed
him with the majesty of learning. The laboratory
with its glass retorts and shelves of chemical compounds
bespoke the infinite latitude of science. Least
of all did he care for the studio, in which the drawing
classes were held. The cubes, pyramids, cones and
spheres did not appear to bear any relation to art as
he saw it. His being craved for something more organic,
and was not satisfied even by the bas-reliefs of ivy and
hedge-roses. To him these were trivial matters of little
concern which might well be omitted from an educational
program. The main hall, with its platform and organ,
its sombre lighting and heavily trussed roof, gave him
far greater satisfaction. In such semi-dark surroundings
he felt that an eager soul might well acquire illumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The terraces outside were correct and ordinary, the
yellow gravel and the deep green grass were too familiar
to attract attention; accordingly he passed to the rear
of the building and explored what lay beyond. Here
he discovered many fives courts—some football grounds,
complete with nasty little pavilions, and a swimming
bath. Further investigation disclosed a fowl-run and
some pigs grunting contentedly in a well-kept sty.
Wynne found these far more to his liking, and was
further interested to learn that a pig will devour a
piece of brick, with apparent relish, provided it has
been given to him by the hand of man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this circumstance he was about to draw some
interesting theories on life, and probably would have
done so had it not been for the compelling note of a
bell. This bell betokened the arrival of tea, some one
had warned him of that; they had also warned him on
no account to be late, so he made his way, hands in
pockets, toward the big dining-room. A large number
of eyes assessed him as he entered, and he bore their
scrutiny without flinching. Oddly enough he was aware
of an agreeable satisfaction arising from their attention,
and returned stare for stare in excellent good part.
Presently some one directed him to a place at the table
where he found himself with other fresh arrivals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inclination to converse is never very marked on
the part of <span class='it'>nouveaux</span>, and for the major part the meal
proceeded in silence. Then presently his left-hand
neighbour, a little boy with a round face and sad blue
eyes, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you like jam?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it to eat,” said Wynne, “but it isn’t much
good to talk about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was discouraging, as the small boy felt, but he
continued bravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to talk about it, but I want to talk
to some one, and I thought that would be an easy way.
I haven’t made a friend yet, and I thought if you’d
like to be a friend I could give you some jam mother
gave me to bring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before Wynne had time to reply to this sweet overture
one of the older boys approached the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All you chaps will go to the gym, when tea is over,”
he announced. “In fact you had better go now.
Come on.” So saying he herded them down a long
corridor to the far end of the building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait in the dressing-room,” he said. “The Council
hasn’t turned up yet. You’ll be called one by one, and
you’d better be jolly careful how you answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The door was shut and they found themselves packed
closely in a small room full of lockers. With a curious
sense of impending evil they waited, and presently a
name was called out, and the first sufferer went forth
to face the dread ordeal of the Council Chamber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was nervy work waiting, since none who went forth
returned to bear witness to what was taking place.
Hours seemed to pass before Wynne’s name was given
by a boy with a low, threatening voice. He stepped
bravely from his confinement, and, hands in pockets,
walked into the centre of the gymnasium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated on a high horizontal bar, at the far end, sat
the four members who composed the Council. Beneath
them, gathered in rough formations, were other boys
whose duty it was to carry out the Council’s awards.
These were the executioneers, and each was skilled in
his craft. Whether the decree went forth in favour
of scragging, knee jarring, or wrist-twisting there was
an expert to conduct it upon orthodox lines. The faces
of the Council, though not remarkable, were stern and
resolute, and bespoke a proper appreciation for the
dignity of office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bring him forward,” said a very plain lad, who
wore round pebble spectacles, and appeared to be leader
of the movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With no great courtesy Wynne was thrust forward
to a chalk circle in the centre of the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t come out of the circle until you have
permission,” was a further instruction received. The
escort drew away and stood with folded arms as befitted
a stern occasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your name?” said he of the spectacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wynne Rendall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wynne Rendall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, you heard! Can we permit the name of
Wynne? Does it belong to the same category of nomenclature
as Eric, Archibald and Desmond, which we have
already black-listed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed a murmur of assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as much. By my troth, it is a sorry
name, and makes the gorge rise in disgust and abhorrence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magnificence of this language created a profound
impression in which even Wynne himself participated.
He was not, however, prepared to allow the speaker to
have it all his own way, since he felt, if it came to the
turning of a phrase, he might show them some skill.
Accordingly he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The name was in no wise my own choice, so I can
take neither blame nor credit for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be silent or be scragged, Wynne Rendall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what is your name, anyway?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker turned his eyes heavenward as though
seeking fresh tolerance from the high gods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know,” he said, “that by no means shall you ask
us to betray our cognomens. We are the Council and
known only by our might. If you are curious, Sir
Paulus Pry, you shall ask some of these others how we
are called—but at another time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Wynne conceived to be highly proper and in
every sense an example of the splendid isolation of the
Ruler. No sane individual would ask a king his name,
but would address the question to a chamberlain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only fly in the amber was the appearance of the
Chief of Council, who went on to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the name Wynne punishment of the second
order shall be inflicted. Is it met?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is met,” droned the Council, with solemn intonation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let us proceed then. What manner of man is thy
father, O Wynne Rendall? Speak us fair, and do not
seek to hide his calling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have not yet found out what manner of man he
is,” replied Wynne, lightning quick to pick up the
pedantry of his interrogator, “but it beseems me he
is a fellow of heavy wit, who bears always a befrowning
countenance. As to his calling he doth trade of
import with our brothers of the Ind for the dried leaf
of the tea plant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech composed and delivered with ceremony
created something of an uproar. Cries were raised that
the penalty of the parallel bars should be summarily
inflicted. In the midst of a chaos of many voices the
Chief of Council held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, young Rendall,” he said, “you’d better
jolly chuck cheeking, or it will be the worse for you.
You answer properly if you don’t want a putrid licking—which
you’ll get anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then go on,” said Wynne, who was enjoying himself
immensely. It was a new and delightful experience
being the centre of attraction, and he felt he had the
situation well in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I proceed, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go forward,” crooned the Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you a gamesman or a swotter? Ponder well
before replying, for much depends upon this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not a gamesman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mark his utterance, O men. Thou art, then, a
swotter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t say so. Don’t even know what a swotter
is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Explain,” said the Chief. And one of the four, a
freckled lad with red hair and a big healthy body, announced:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A swotter is the sort of ass who mugs at lessons and
thinks more of books than footer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Council will sing the Song of the Swotter,”
said the Chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So the Council sang—</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The swotter is a rotter,</p>
<p class='line0'>And we always make it hotter</p>
<p class='line0'>For the swotter who’s a rotter—</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Yes, we do.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, we do,” was repeated by all present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When this impressive rendering was over, Wynne replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I am a swotter all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it remembered,” said the Chief. “Little remains
to be said. The C. I. D. will now report on this miscreant’s
behaviour since arrival.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon a foxy little boy came forward from one
of the groups, and after making a profound obeisance
to the Council began:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has worn his cap on the back of his head and
put his hands in his trousers’ pocket. I have been to
his bedder, and he wears a woollen nightshirt and combinations
instead of pants and vest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne felt himself flush with hot anger and resentment,
and heard an expression of disgust from all
present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are these things true, O most wretched Wynne
Rendall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, they are, but how dared that beastly little
swine touch my box?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be silent—scrag him—scrag the swotter,” came from
all sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care—he’s a dirty little⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pin him,” ordered the Chief, with a gesture so
commanding that he all but fell from his perch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very adroitly two volunteers stepped forward and
twisted Wynne’s wrists under his shoulder blades, while
a third, with a skill which would have defied the ingenuity
of the Davenport Brothers, made fast his hands
with a knotted kerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work accomplished they stood aside and refolded
their arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass judgment,” they demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judgment shall be passed,” said the Chief. “You,
Wynne Rendall, have been given fair and lawful trial,
and are found guilty on several counts. First, you bear
a name that is unpleasant to the tooth, and for this nose-pressure
shall be inflicted.” (The presser of noses girt
his loins for battle, and examined a row of shiny
knuckles to see that all was in order.) “Second, your
reply when asked of your father’s doings was too cheeky
by a long chalk, and for this two circuits of the frog-march
shall be administered.” (The frog-marcher-extraordinary
made no movement, but he smiled as one
who knew full well his own potentiality.) “Third, and
methinks the gravest charge of all, it is established that
thou art a swotter, and for this the ordeal of the parallel
bars must and shall befall you.” Eight boys stepped
forward, but the Chief shook his head. “Three a side
will suffice,” he said. “That much mercy will I grant
thee on account of your miserable size. The punishment
for the nightshirt and the combinations will be the
shame of wearing them, but I put it forward that they
may help us in deciding a proper nickname for you.
After the punishments have been inflicted you will step
once more into the circle and declare you will not attempt
to use your trousers’ pockets until the beginning
of your second term. This you will swear most solemnly
by the Goal-post and the Fives Ball. O men! has the
word gone forth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do the punishments meet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They meet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them go forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had scarcely time to appreciate the anguish
inflicted by the nose-twister before he found himself
ignominiously drummed round the gymnasium at the
knee of the frog-marcher. It was a jarring and painful
means of progression, and almost he welcomed the
narrow invitation of the parallel bars which loomed before
him at the close of the second circuit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The variety offered, however, was far from consoling,
and during the few moments’ pressure in that inhospitable
spot he feared his last hour had come. He was
made to form a buffer in the middle, while three boys
on either side, bracing their legs against the upright
supports, pushed toward the centre with their united
strength. He could feel his ribs caving inward and the
breath was forced from his lungs. Respite came not a
moment too soon, and when they drew away he hung
over the bar in an ecstasy of exhaustion and nausea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not until he heard the voice of the Chief announcing
that he had borne the ordeal in honourable
silence that he was aware he had forborne to scream.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Help him to the circle,” came from a far-off voice,
but he shook aside the proffered assistance and tottered
to the circle unaided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your bearing has been creditable,” said the Chief,
“and that inclines us to leniency. Speak by the Goal-post
and Fives Ball that the word may be fulfilled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then said Wynne, with a somewhat hysterical catch
in his voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear by the Goal-post and the Fives Ball that to
save myself the pain of offending you fools I’ll keep
my hands out of my pockets for as long as you stupidly
want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the world became singularly black, the sky full
of crimson stars, and he sat down awkwardly upon the
floor with his head between his knees.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It would be far from the truth to state that Wynne
Rendall was popular at school. On account of the readiness
of his wit and an adroit, if somewhat embittered,
knack of turning a phrase, he achieved a kind of
notoriety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mentally he was always more of a match for his
physical superiors, as those who came up against him
in differences of any kind were compelled to testify.
There was a quality of courage about him that at once
perplexed and irritated. The threat of a licking was of
no avail in turning his point of view, and he would
stand up courageously to a battery of blows which on
some occasions, by pure vital energy, he would return
with interest. But in the main his companions avoided
offering him offence, since to do so was generally the
occasion of their own downfall. He possessed a faculty,
somewhat rare in the infant outfit, of being able to follow
his opponent’s mental processes, and this, coupled with
a ready power of expression, gave him an instant ascendancy.
Intuitively he knew the very thing they were
least likely to desire to hear, and although he was not
of a naturally caustic bent, he would not hesitate to
employ it if the situation demanded. Very early he
made the discovery that loud-voiced, broad-shouldered
fellows were by no means invulnerable, and indeed might
very well prove cowards at heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The type he found greatest difficulty in dealing with
was the muscular and sheep-minded lad who from sheer
natural stupidity was insensible to verbal attacks. This
type was represented by a fairly large section, and, on
account of their bulk, could not with impunity be
ignored. They were a piratical band of burly buccaneers,
who would undertake any dirty work if the
premium offered were sufficiently tempting. They hired
themselves out to smaller boys who desired the “licking”
of some one they were unable to vanquish themselves,
and for the service rendered would exact a very
heavy toll in stationery or delicacies from the tuck-shop.
Being impervious to conscience, they were only accessible
by other means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days after his arrival Wynne had his first experience
of the workings of this band.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was walking by the Fives Court with Cedric
Allen, the small boy who had offered jam and friendship,
when the foxy youth, who had borne witness to
his possession of a nightshirt, hailed and bade them stop.
Lipchitty, for so he was named, addressed them in tones
of authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to speak to this kid, but you can stop,
young Rendall. Now then, kiddie Allen, I want your
Swedish knife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cedric quailed before these dread tidings. The knife
was a most important affair, and boasted a handle of
bird’s-eye maple of unequalled loveliness. It was reputed
that this knife would kill a man, and its possession
had excited an interest in Cedric that might well dissipate
with its passing. Wherefore, in a trembling
fashion, he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My sister gave it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lipchitty was very properly disgusted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The sort of soppy thing she would do,” he replied,
and brought a flush of resentment to Cedric’s round
little face. “ ’Tany rate, I’m going to have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You aren’t. You shan’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t give it to me there’ll be a jolly fine
licking for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cedric weighed his chances before replying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not much bigger than me; p’r’aps you’d
get licked if you tried.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t mean to try,” responded the base Lipchitty;
“I shall get Monkton major to do it for me, and he’ll
half kill you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monkton major was no idle threat—a fellow of vast
proportions with a gross and sullen countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In imagination Cedric saw his beloved possession float
over the horizon, but he made one final effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he lick me? I haven’t done anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall give him some silkworms to do it,” announced
Lipchitty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The system was exposed. Terrorism at a price.
Wynne Rendall’s quick brain seized on the flaw, and
was away with it in a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right!” he interrupted, “then I’ll give him a
fountain pen not to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shut up,” warned Lipchitty, but there was
alarm in his voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better not. If you do I’ll give him a Brownie
to lick you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne laughed. “Then,” he said, “I’ll give him
five and six to lick you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lipchitty trembled, for the price was rising out of
all expectation. Dared he bounce it another sixpence
and overthrow his opponent? The risk was great, so he
temporized with—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much have you got? I warn you I’ve ten bob,
so you’d better look out!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten bob! The game was in Wynne’s hands. With
cruel leisure Wynne produced his adored letter-case and
took out the five-pound note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s done you,” he cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of so much wealth staggered Master Lipchitty,
who with a mumbled unpleasantry started to
move away. But the spirit of reprisals was upon
Wynne, and he called on him to stop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Lipchitty, I haven’t done with you.
You started this business, and now you are going to finish
it. It was you who made me out a fool before the
Council by sneaking into my box. Very well, you’ve
jolly well got to swop a pair of pyjamas for one of my
nightshirts or I’ll give Monkton major ten and six to
lick you silly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Wynne slept very honourably in a coat and
trousers of delicate striped taffeta, while Lipchitty
mumbled in his sleep and dreamed lurid dreams of knife-thrusts
in dark corridors, and enemies cast unsuspectingly
into the yawning shaft of the <span class='it'>oubliette</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The prediction that Wynne Rendall would prove a
swotter was more than amply borne out by his conduct
in the class-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In most branches of education he displayed voracity
for learning to an unusual extent. Latin and Greek
delighted his soul, and his form-master, who was not a
man of great erudition, was sorely put to it to keep pace
with the extraordinary rapidity with which he acquired
a knowledge of these dead tongues. His translations
were admirable, and he seemed capable of reproducing
the original spirit and lilt of the lines into English prose.
Horace, Virgil, Homer were more than mere tasks to
Wynne; they were delights which breathed of the
splendid freedom in thought and action of the old
periods which had passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a very large degree he possessed appreciation for
what Ruskin so happily terms “the aristocracy of
words.” He realized how one word allied to another
made for dignity or degradation, and he strove never
to commit himself to an expression in writing that did
not bear the stamp of honourable currency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the school library he acquired his taste for the
poets—one or another of which he carried with him on
all his wanderings and greedily assimilated. Unlike
most early readers he did not pin allegiance to any particular
writer, but pored over all with equal concentration,
carrying away the best from each in his remarkably
retentive memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But for his incurable stupidity in regard to mathematics,
it is probable at the age of sixteen he would
have been head of the school, but mathematics defeated
him at every turn. He hated figures, and it was characteristic
that he would never attempt to acquire a better
liking for the things he hated. He ignored and passed
them over, admitting neither the interest nor the logic
that lay in the science of figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a great pity, Rendall, that you will not concentrate
on these matters,” said the Head. “You display
ready enough intelligence in other directions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, sir,” he said, “but I find no satisfaction
in mathematics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should feel the satisfaction of doing a thing
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reward doesn’t tempt me, sir. Given that the
answer to a most intricate problem proves to be .03885—what
has been achieved beyond a row of figures? In
after years none will look back and say, ‘He was the
man who found this answer,’ for the reason that there
is no charm or beauty in his findings. To the eye of
the onlooker, sir, .04996 would be none the less pleasing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it would be wrong,” urged the Head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nero was wrong in setting fire to Rome, yet people
still speak of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They speak in horror, Rendall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And a certain amount of admiration, sir. He was
artist enough to play upon a harp while the roof beams
crackled and fell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid your instance suggests a certain laxity
of moral outlook, Rendall, which one can only deplore.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne looked up at the ceiling and smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He created a stir, sir—that is what I am getting at.
Good may have resulted too. Possibly a deal of pestilence
was scorched out of the city in that mighty fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Head eyed him seriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me see, Rendall,” he said, “how old are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixteen, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sixteen. You are a precocious boy. You have
revolutionary qualities that do not altogether please me.
You are far too introspective, and introspection is a
dangerous thing in unskilled hands. It is a pity you
do not cultivate a greater taste for outdoor games.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, but I don’t want to shine in after
life as a cup-tie footballer or a Rugby international.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly not, but healthy exercise promotes a healthy
mind, my boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe, sir, that is the general opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You venture to doubt it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, sir, I would not attach much value to a
champion heavyweight’s views on a matter of æsthetics.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Æsthetics are beside the point altogether. Too
much æsthetics is quite as bad as—as⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too much football, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are disposed to be impertinent, Rendall; I have
no desire to staunch the flowings of your brain, but I
would remind you that God equipped mankind with legs
and arms, and it was clearly not the intention that we
should allow them to stagnate from disuse. That is a
piece of wisdom you would do well in taking to heart.
A brain that is overworked will conduct its owner unworthily,
therefore I should tonic yours with a little
exercise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had never held a very high opinion of the
Head since the day he had been informed of the mysteries
of perpetuating the species. On that occasion the Head
had fallen very considerably in his esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had floundered sorrowfully in his logic, had shown
embarrassment, and made a muddle of what he had to
say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason the good man had confused the subject
with the commandment, “Thou shalt not commit
adultery,” and as his exposition was by no means clear
on either count Wynne had been greatly perplexed. He
was informed of certain consequences of sex and at the
same time warned that indulgence was forbidden.
When it was over he felt he had been told of something
which by holy law was impossible of achievement.
He left the study far more uncertain as to how the race
was perpetuated than he had been on entering. Incidentally
he felt rather sick, and in the privacy of his
little den he had thrown his books about and stared at
himself in the glass with a new and half-fledged understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was, however, a singularly sexless boy, and the
effect produced was of no very enduring character. Sex
curiosity had no abiding place in his disposition, and
he entirely failed to understand the impulse which compelled
some of the older boys to bring opera glasses to
bear on the windows of the servants’ quarters in the
hope that some disrobing act might be espied and magnified.
He would take no part in the whispered conversation
that forms part of a nightly program in practically
every school, and found no reason to reverence those
scions of adventure who, with a wealth of imagination,
drew pictures of their conquests over undefended citadels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reserve he was almost unanimously dubbed a
prig, but with little enough justice. Wynne possessed
no great distaste for wrong as being wrong; indeed, in
many cases, wrong appealed to him more generously
than the accepted view of right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the schoolboy form of especial backstairs carnalism
that provoked in him the greatest distaste. There
was, he thought, something sordid and paltry about an
enterprise that could only be referred to in half-tones.
If one sinned one should sin openly as Nero had done,
and play upon a lyre while the smoke of one’s sinning
columned to the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is in the make-up of most growing boys a substratum
of nastiness, and it may well prove to be an
act of divine providence that this should be so. By the
great Law of Contrast our judgments are made. They
are made in contrast to the error of our earlier ways.
From the lowest stage we step to higher planes and look
back with timid disgust on thoughts and actions we have
left behind. It is seldom enough, thank God, we consider
our vulgar embryonic excesses in any other light
than that of a degrading folly which, by the grace of
better understanding, we have filtered from our systems.
It is seldom enough that the most perverted boy carries
out into the world the brand of his unmoral beginnings.
There should be comfort in this for the parent whose
son returns from school before the holidays begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was coldly unmoved by the most lurid
imaginings of sex. He would merely shrug his shoulder
and go elsewhere. Yet mentally he was every kind of
sensualist. The music of words stirred him illimitably—it
would quicken his pulses and shorten his breath
as no bold appeal from the eyes could have done. He
could recognize love in the grand periods of the poets,
and gasp with emotion at the splendour and passion it
bespoke; but to associate love with the individual, or to
consider himself in the light of a possible lover, never
entered his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so he passed over his period of first knowledge
and learnt nothing from the lesson.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall returned home for the summer vacation
in his seventeenth year. He was heavily laden with
prizes and lightly poised with enthusiasm. In every department
of learning, save only mathematics, had he
borne himself with honourable success. It was not unnatural,
therefore, he should have looked for some expression
of rejoicing from his parents, but herein he was
destined to be disappointed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father had not returned from the City when he
arrived, but he found his mother in the drawing-room.
Her old allegiance to embroidering antimacassars had
by no means abated with years, and as Wynne entered
she was still mismating her coloured silks with the afore-time
guarantee of hideousness. But even this circumstance
would not staunch the enthusiasm Wynne felt
in his own prowess. The desire to impart the news of
his successes was perhaps the youngest trait in his character,
so when the greeting was over he broke out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done simply splendidly, mother. I’ve simply
walked away with all the prizes, and the classic master
says my Greek verses are the best the school has ever
produced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes sparkled as though to say, “There, what do
you think of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had Mrs. Rendall known it she would have recognized
that here was a moment to win a large measure of her
son’s affection. Encouragement given at the right time
is the surest road to the heart. But hers, alas! was not
an analytic mind. All she contrived to say was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Well, that’s quite nice, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” exclaimed Wynne. “You’re hopeless.” And
that is a very dreadful thing for a boy to say to his
mother—and a more dreadful thing for him to feel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Rendall laid aside her work, and remarked, “I
am sure I don’t know why you should say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it is so—so deplorable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. Doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s true—that’s just it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did I say? I said it was quite nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You did. But don’t let’s talk any more about
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you replied that I was hopeless. You must
have had some reason for saying that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, none at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been different if I had said it wasn’t
nice, but I said the right thing and you were rude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne did not reply, but he breathed despairfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a great pity to be rude, Wynne, and you should
try to guard against it. You will never get on if your
manners are not nice. Your Great-uncle Bryan” (he
was a deceased relation on her side of the family who
had made a nice little income as a chemist) “attributed
his success entirely to the possession of an agreeable
counter-manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Preserve me from that,” cried Wynne, and fled from
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his father returned from the City the scene
in many respects was re-enacted. Mr. Rendall senior
ignored his son’s classical and literary successes, and
focused his attention upon the absence of any achievement
on mathematical lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lot of use Socrates and all these other Latin chaps
are if you can’t cast up a row of figures!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fancy that Socrates was a Greek,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not going to quibble about that. He could have
been an Esquimaux for all the good he’ll do you in the
City.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had been expecting this for some time, and he
replied with a steady voice,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t take him to the City, father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not. Better forget all about him and fix your
mind on things that matter. How did you do with
book-keeping?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did nothing. I wish to make books, not to keep
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t want any racecourse jargon here, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You misunderstand me. I ought to have said write
books.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are plenty of books without your writing
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a good thing Shakespeare’s father didn’t think
so!” mused Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Rendall ignored the interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m giving you one more term at school, so make
the best use of it. You are not by any means a fool,
and what your brother Wallace could do you should be
able to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace was already established in a clerkship whither
he daily proceeded in a silk hat. Being drawn into the
conversation he felt it incumbent upon himself to offer
a contribution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will find in the City, Wynne, people are not
inclined to put up with a lot of nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think it unlikely I shall find out anything of the
kind,” replied Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say you will,” retorted his brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I repeat I think it is unlikely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your brother Wallace knows what he’s talking
about,” said Mr. Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s it!” exclaimed Wynne, jumping to his feet;
“he knows what he is talking about, and that is all he
ever can or ever will know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you sit down at table!” ordered Mr. Rendall.
“I never saw such an exhibition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is terrible,” lamented Mrs. Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You listen to what your elders have to say, and don’t
talk so much yourself. Your brother Wallace is making
thirty-five shillings a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O most wonderful Wallace!” cried Wynne. “Villon
starved in a gaol and wrote exquisite verses, but he
could not earn so much as brother Wallace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, young Wynne,” exclaimed his brother,
“you had better shut up if you don’t want me to punch
your head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Scots wha hae wi’ Wallace bled,’ ” chanted Wynne
irrepressibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father! Can’t you speak to him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak to him be damned!” said Mr. Rendall, for
no particular reason. “He’s got to toe the line, that’s
what it amounts to—toe the line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when I’ve toed the line, what then?” demanded
Wynne; but none seemed able to supply the answer, and
the advice to “shut up about it” could hardly be regarded
as illuminating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The argument concluded with the brief comment from
his father:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll talk to you in the morning.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The matter was not broached again until after breakfast
on the following day, when Wynne and his father
were left alone over the empty cups and dishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Discuss your future!” announced Mr. Rendall. He
rose and placed a lump of sugar between the bars of the
canary’s cage. The canary chirruped to signify gratitude
for the gift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me there is no advantage keeping you at
school any longer. Bit of practical experience in life
will lick you into shape quicker than anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One minute,” said Wynne, “I believe I could get a
University scholarship if you gave me another term.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Scholarship be damned! I never went to a University;
no reason why you should go. Not going anyway⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet. D’y’hear! There can be altogether too
much of a good thing—too much altogether. I have my
own plans for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so have I,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll make them fit in with mine—got that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s foot began to tap on the ground and his
mouth straightened thinly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go on in my own damned time. A little hard
discipline is what you want and it’s what you’ll get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I spoke to Kessles on the ’phone last night about
putting you there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kessles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The warehouse people—don’t you know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you know? Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit hard on Mr. Kessles then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiet. He’s prepared to give you an opening, and
I’ve accepted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just as well, because I certainly shouldn’t
have done so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not putting up with any argument. You can
have a couple of weeks holiday, then go up to the City
like any one else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head resolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no question about the matter, my boy, it is
a case of ‘having to.’ High time you began to make
a way in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Wynne. “I’ll make a way in the world—I
want to and I shall—but it will be <span class='it'>my</span> way, not
yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that I am not going to the City—I absolutely
refuse—absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Continue like that and I won’t be answerable for
my actions,” cried Mr. Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you shan’t be for mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The determination in Wynne’s tone was extraordinary
considering his age and fragility. Without raising his
voice he dominated his father by every means of expression.
Mr. Rendall felt this to be so, and the shame of
it scarleted his features.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you were born,” he shouted, “you have been
perverse and maddening—ever since the day you were
born!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never once since the day I was born have you tried
to see how my mind worked,” came the retort. “You
have done no more than force your mental workings on
me. All I know or shall know will be in spite of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you no proper feelings?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not as you read the word. Proper feelings are
free feelings, new thoughts and fresh touches of all that
is wonderful and unexplored. You think in a circle—an
inner circle that constricts everything worth while
like the coils of a snake. And now I’ve had enough of
it—enough of you—more than enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m going—I’m going to clear out and find some
atmosphere where I can breathe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you dare to suggest running away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m clearing out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some half-formed thought drove Mr. Rendall to seize
the handle and put his back against the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t stop me,” said Wynne. “It isn’t a race
for the front door, which I lose if you’re quick enough
to stop me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” conceded Mr. Rendall. “Very well—and
how the devil do you think you’d live! Hey?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall manage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Manage be damned! Not a penny shall you have
from me—not a farthing—not a bean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take back what I have already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s hands dived into his trousers’ pockets and
pulled out the linings. Two or three florins and a few
odd pence tumbled to the floor and circled in all directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the action deprived Mr. Rendall of the
last of his self-control. Seizing the silver entrée dish
he sent it hurtling through the lower pane of the dining-room
window. It was the first time his temper had
risen to such heights.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let in the air,” cried Wynne, with a note of hysteria,
and picking up the pair of candlesticks from the mantelshelf
he flung first one then the other through the remaining
panes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The south-west wind bellied the Nottingham lace
curtains and stirred the feathers in the canary’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twirrup,” he chirped, and hopping to the upper
perch broke into a fine song of the palms that bow so
statelily in the islands of the south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out!” said Mr. Rendall. “I’ve done with you—get
out!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne packed a suit case in his own time. He was
not fastidious in the matter of clothes, and books were
the chief things he took. Oddly enough he had no fear
in facing the world alone. Possibly through inexperience
the problem presented no alarming features. He
did not imagine he was stepping out to meet an immediate
fortune—education and added years had taught
him that his singing days were still far ahead. He was
confidently sure he would arrive eventually, but in the
meantime the world lay before him—a mighty class-room
through which he must pass before setting foot upon
the Purple Patch. Bearing the bag in his hand he descended
the stairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hall he hesitated. Should he or should he not
seek his mother and risk the possibility of a further
scene. The problem was solved by her sudden appearance
at the door of the drawing-room. In some respects
her face had lost its wonted stolidity. She seemed as
one perplexed by vague understandings. Cain might
have looked so when he saw death for the first time in
the fall of his brother, and wondered stupidly what
manner of thing it might be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you are going away, Wynne,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.” But she did not see very clearly, as her next
remark betokened. “Have you packed your clean
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some human reason Wynne had no inclination to
smile at this. It struck him as being somewhat pathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think so,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right. Did you ask cook to cut you some
sandwiches?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, mother. I—I don’t think you quite understand.
I’m not going away just for the day—I’m going for
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For good!” repeated Mrs. Rendall, in an expressionless
voice. “Really? Yes, well that does seem a
pity. Your father had a nice opening for you with
Mr. Kessles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think I should have flourished in an office,
mother. I want to do and do and do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might have gone to the office in the day-time
and done a little writing in the evening. I am sure
your father wouldn’t have objected to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head. “Wouldn’t work,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. Your brother Wallace finds time
for chip-carving after city hours. He made me such
a nice blotter last month—very pretty it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tisn’t quite the same, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t know, one hobby is very like another.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” said Wynne, “but I’ll have to go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where will you go to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How very extraordinary! But you might turn up
anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” He fidgeted. It was hard to find anything
to say. “I’d better be off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you any money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But I want none of father’s—I’ll take none
of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would take some of mine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you can’t go away to nowhere without any
money. Wait a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He demurred, but she took no notice, and went upstairs
to her room. When she returned she gave him
two ten-pound notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have given you these on your eighteenth
birthday, Wynne, so you may as well have them now.
I did the same for Wallace when he was eighteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the old symmetry coming out again—a clock
in the middle, and a candlestick on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks awfully much,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is part of what I inherited from your Great-uncle
Bryan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem had spoken the truth when he said,
“Others will build the pulpit from which you hope to
preach.” Wynne was going out to face the world on
the reflected gilt of an agreeable counter-manner!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, Wynne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was surprising when he kissed her she should have
said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I am going to cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He answered quickly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t—really I shouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crying is so infectious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I needn’t—but I could—I—I’m not sure
I shan’t have to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s quite all right,” said Wynne. He kissed her
again and hurried down the steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind blowing through the broken window
slammed the front door noisily. It occurred to Mrs.
Rendall that the curtains might knock over the palm
pedestal. Following the direction of her thoughts she
moved to the dining-room to take steps. Her husband
had said Wynne would return—“would crawl back on
hands and knees”—and suppose he did not return?
Well, then he wouldn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hers was the kind of concentration that attaches more
importance to airing a person’s sheets than to the person
himself. Crying was of little service, and the impulse
had lessened with the peril of the palm pedestal
to be considered.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Many courageous people are nervous to a fault in
certain directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall possessed the pluck of the devil where
his point of view or ideals were at stake, but in the
performance of simple everyday affairs he was afflicted
with a great shyness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hovered fearfully before the portals of several
small hotels in the Strand district before summoning
up courage to enter and take a room. It seemed to
him the proprietors of these places would refuse and
ridicule him—that they would tax him with his youth,
and query if he had ever used a razor. Yet men great
and small, of important or insignificant appearance,
passed in and out of the swinging doors with the smallest
concern imaginable. They dropped their baggage in
the hall, and conversed with the clerks about rooms as
he might have helped himself to salt at the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all his life Wynne had never stopped at an hotel,
and had no experience from which to adjust his actions.
He realized, however, that to delay the ordeal indefinitely
would serve no useful purpose. An hotel attracted his
attention on the opposite side of the road, and squaring
his shoulders he boldly approached it. His shame was
boundless when he walked deliberately past the open
doors and down once more to the Strand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the most cowardly thing I have ever done,”
he rated himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Villers Street he espied an eating-house with an
uncooked sirloin, embellished with parsley and tomatoes,
standing on a silver salver in the window. He halted
and read the various legends pasted to the inner surface
of the plate glass. “A good dinner for 1s. 6d.”
“Steaks and onions.” “Stewed tripe.” “Bed and
breakfast, 3s.” Without waiting for his courage to ebb
he walked inside. A dirty Swiss waiter pulled a chair
from a small table and flicked the seat invitingly with a
napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want—that is, would you be good enough to let
me a room. I was recommended to come here—at least
I think⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A room—sartainly—one minute,” he called a name
through an open door, and a stout lady entered. “A
room for zis gentleman. You will go wiz her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he mounted the stairs Wynne reflected that there
was nothing in it after all. It was the simplest matter.
He wished he had omitted the legend about having
been recommended to the place; clearly there was no
occasion for anything beyond a simple expression of
one’s needs. He had not thought to learn anything from
a Swiss waiter in a Villers Street hotel, yet a new department
of learning had been opened for him from
which he might profit in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The room to which he was shown was very ordinary,
and made little impression upon him. He threw his
bag to the bed and seated himself easily beside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The landlady lingered by the door, and he ventured
a remark to her:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you let quite a number of rooms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be,” she answered, “a bad thing for us
if we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As there appeared to be nothing further to contribute
to that line of inquiry, he nodded and remained
silent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll want a bit of dinner, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, thank you—thanks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you was to order it now it would be ready when
you come down.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he said. Then, as she still lingered:
“I think I’ll wash my hands if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll you have to eat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course! It was so obvious—he ought to have
thought of that. What could he have? It would betray
inexperience to ask what there was—a man of the
world would know in an instant what his appetite desired.
Wynne had often pictured himself ordering a
dinner, but now the time had come he felt strangely
unable to do so. His memory served him with a picture
of the uncooked sirloin and the tomatoes, but it was
unlikely they would oven this on his behalf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The need to answer being imperative, he ordered “A
chop, please, and some potatoes.” After the departure
of the landlady he cursed his woeful lack of imagination.
He had dreamed to feast, as the old emperors,
upon ortolans and the brains of peacocks, and instead
he had ordered the very dish which, in the ordinary
rotation of the home-menu, would have appeared on his
father’s table that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before going downstairs Wynne decided very firmly
what he would say when asked as to his choice of drink.
He would order shandy-gaff, and he would name it
familiarly as “shandy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This resolve completed, he opened his suit case and
set out his belongings in careless disorder. Beyond
doubt it was very fine to be a free-lance and possess
a room of one’s own in the heart of London. He took
a pace or two up and down the floor and filled his
lungs with air. The rumble of traffic and the long-sustained
London note, made up of thousands of fine
particles of sound, drifted to his ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something like!” said Wynne. “This is something
like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put his head out of the window and spoke again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You silly old crowds, all hurrying along. You
don’t know me—but one day you shall. Yes, I shall
find out all your secrets, and you will come to me to
disclose them. Oh! you silly, busy, hurrying old
crowds, I’m getting ready for you. Why don’t you
look up and see me? Don’t you want to? There’s no
charge yet. Look while you have the chance, for later
on I shall tip up your chins and hold your eyes whether
you want me to or not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But none was disposed to glance his way. The day’s
work was done, and London emptying itself homeward.
There were dinners, warm fires, and welcomes awaiting
them, why should they waste a glance upon the white
face of an anæmic boy who hung out over the sill of a
three-shilling bedroom and blathered his foolish thoughts
to the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne ordered “shandy” with an air of some importance:
by sheer bad luck the Swiss waiter’s vocabulary
was deficient of this word. He asked Wynne to
repeat it, and, still failing to understand, further asked
how the beverage was concocted. This threw Wynne
into a blushing difficulty, since he himself was doubtful
as to the ingredients used. Accordingly he revoked the
order and asked for some ale, and since he stated no
particular quantity he was saddled with a bottle of the
largest size, which greatly taxed his powers of consumption.
He struggled bravely, however, and the good malt
fluid gave tone to his being and warmed his imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose from the table with the pleasant confidence
that he had left much of his awkwardness behind. He
had thought to spend the evening considering his future,
but in his rosy mood he decided a theatre would prove
a more agreeable form of entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto his playgoing had been confined to a yearly
visit to the local pantomime, a performance which had
made no special appeal to him. As master of his own
choice he repaired to Shakespeare’s Henry VIII., and
was vastly impressed by the splendour of it all. Here
and there he found himself at variance with the actors’
renderings of certain passages, and during the intervals
ruminated upon alternative readings. On the whole,
however, the experience was delightful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion he emerged from the theatre in a
state of artistic intoxication. He longed for a companion
to whom he could express the views which the play
had set in motion—any one would do so long as he might
speak his thoughts aloud. With all these jostling
crowds it was absurd that any one should be denied an
audience. Surely some one would be glad to lend an
ear. There must be some companionable soul in this
great city with a thirst for knowledge and enlightenment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The clouds that gather round the setting sun.”
Wolsey had been wrong to betray so much emotion
in delivering that speech. A man like Wolsey would
see grim humour in his own downfall. It was contrary
to the character, as he saw it, to stress the emotions
of such a coming to pass. Wynne knew the speech
intimately, and felt a great desire to repeat it aloud
in the way it should be repeated. The Haymarket was
hardly a place for such a recital, so he turned into
Orange Street and the narrow thoroughfares adjoining.
Here in a shadow he began the lines, but had hardly
uttered a sound before a step caused him to stop. Looking
round he saw a girl walking slowly toward him.
A fur swung from her shoulders and a bag dangled in
her hand. The white of her boots seemed phosphorescent
in the half-light. As she came abreast of him
their eyes met. Hers were bold and black-lashed, and
the lids drooped in lazy insolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kiddie,” she said, “coming home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Wynne was startled into replying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, do you want a friend too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She curled her scarlet lips into a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always want a friend,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t,” he said; “only sometimes! Sometimes
one feels one must confide. I feel like that tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Confide in me, then. What’s to stop you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I will. You’re frank—unconventional;
some one like you I’ve been looking for. I couldn’t
sleep tonight—couldn’t go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The smile came again—went—and was replaced by
an expression of perplexity. It was not the conversational
formula to which she was accustomed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, don’t let’s hang about, anyway,” she said.
“There’s sure to be a cab in Waterloo Place. Come
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you live far from here, then? It would be jollier
to walk, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had heard that phrase before, on the lips of
economists, and the business side of her nature sprang
to action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ve no money—better say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve plenty of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call plenty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let’s talk money. People never speak of anything
else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beginning to think you know a thing or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I do.” The suggestion flattered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, and I’d like to know what I’m standing for,
too. I’m too fly to bounce, kiddie. Get me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied. “I don’t understand what you’re
talking about.” He hated confessing this, but it was
no less than the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of—course—not,” she drawled the syllables, and
leaned against his shoulder with fingers that travelled
caressingly over his wrist and palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O God!” exclaimed Wynne. “I see.” A kind of
fear possessed him and he backed a pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only—only that I’m a fool. I must be. You’re
Adventure, aren’t you? Commercial Adventure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then! Who are you calling names?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must be a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This concerned him most, and provided him with
courage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All boys are fools—men too, for that matter. Come
along if you’re coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m not,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mistake, eh? You’re a cheeky little devil. Who
are you to speak to a girl? I should like to ask?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t recognize you, that’s all. I’ve never met
you before. Another time I shall know. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned quickly and walked away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly little kid!” murmured the girl, and fell into
her roving pace once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had told her how rotten I thought she was,”
mused Wynne, as he pulled off his boots before getting
to bed. “I might have gone home with her!” He
tried to picture such a happening, but it brought nothing
to his imagination. There was not the slightest tremble
of passion to weigh against his satisfaction at having
avoided the offered temptation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fools men must be to yield to that sort. I never
should. I think I got out of it all right after the first
mistake. Original sin!” He fell to quoting Swinburne,
a poet who had pleased his ear alone.</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“What sterile growth of sexless root or Epicene,</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;What flower of kisses without fruit of love, Faustine.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“She was very pretty—pretty figure—and her hands
and feet were small. Yes, all the temptation was there,
and I didn’t yield. Glad I met her. It’s helped me
to know myself. I’m all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he drew the blanket under his chin Wynne felt
unduly self-satisfied—he forgot, perhaps, that it is easy
to resist when there is no impulse to sin.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the National Gallery on the following morning
Wynne fell into conversation with an old man. The
old man wore an Inverness cape and a wide-brimmed
felt hat, he had shaggy eyebrows, a wispy moustache,
and his cheeks were seamed and furrowed with wrinkles.
He muttered to himself and seemed in a fine rage. Sometimes
he rattled his umbrella and scowled at the passers-by,
and sometimes he tossed his head and laughed
shortly. Scarcely a soul came nigh him that he did not
scrutinize closely and disapprovingly. Before him was
Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks,” and by his mutterings
and rattles he kept the space before the picture
clear of other humanity, as a sheep-dog rings his flock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Wynne approached he came under the influence
of the old gentleman’s inflamed stare, which, being in
no wise alarmed, he returned with interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep your eyes for the pictures,” rapped out this
peculiar individual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I would,” returned Wynne, “if it were not
that you disturbed them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! You’re like all the rest. You’d run from
your own bridal altar to see a cab-horse jump the area
railings. I know the breed—I know ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Concentration is easily dislocated,” said Wynne,
choosing his words carefully, “attention is dependent
upon circumstance and atmosphere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, enough, O most wise Telemachus,” came the
answer, with a mixture of agreement and cynicism,
“the very reason for <span class='it'>my</span> invitation. How the devil
shall a man keep his mind on this” (he nodded at the
picture) “while this herd is using the Gallery as a
shelter from the rain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne laughed. An attack on the people always
gave him pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a fair statement of the case. The sun’ll
be out in a minute,” he cocked his eye to the sky-light.
“Then we shall have the place to ourselves.
Mark my words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve no artistic appreciation,” said Wynne, feeling
on safe ground. “A very bovine race, the English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tommy rot!” said the old gentleman, unexpectedly;
“don’t talk drivelling nonsense. Best race in the world,
the English, but they won’t let ’emselves go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, doesn’t that amount to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it don’t. You can’t judge the speed of a racehorse
while he is munching oats in a stable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir; but presumably the people should come here
to appreciate. They can do their munching at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rubbish! English folk are too shy to express appreciation.
That’s the trouble with ’em—shyness.
National code! They keep away from all matters likely
to excite ’em artistically for fear of being startled into
expressing their true feelings. Englishmen’s idea of
bad form, expression! Damn fine people! Bovine?
Not a bit of it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seemingly, to be consistent was not a characteristic
of the old gentleman, a circumstance which rendered
argument difficult. Wynne fell back on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, it was you who attacked them first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know I did. Good reason too. A lot of clattering
feet thumping past my Leonardo! Scattering my
thoughts. ’Taint right—’taint reverent. If I’d my
way I’d allow no one to enter here who hadn’t graduated
to a degree in the arts—or respect for the arts.
’Tisn’t decent for people to use as a waiting-room a gallery
holding some of the world’s greatest achievements
on canvas. It’s degrading and disgraceful. Why
aren’t we taught to respect art from infancy, hey? And
pay it proper compliments, too. We have to take our
hats off in a twopenny tin chapel, and are thought
blackguards and infidels if we keep ’em on, but do we
ever touch a forelock to a masterpiece in paint, and does
any one think any the worse of us however idiotically we
behave before it? No! Then I say that we are no better
than hooligans and savages, and have no right of contact
with the glorious emblems of what a man’s hand and
a man’s head can achieve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This speech he delivered with enthusiasm and a
profusion of gesture. Wynne was properly impressed,
and hoped the old gentleman would proceed, which he
readily did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Gad a’mighty!” he ejaculated, pointing a claw-like
forefinger at Leonardo’s Virgin. “Whenever I
doubt the Scriptures I look at her and the doubt passes.
Da Vinci <span class='it'>saw</span> her. <span class='it'>Saw</span> her, and he painted what he
saw—the flesh and the spirit. See the eyelids, they
tremble—don’t they? They are never at rest. That’s
the woman essence—the mother essence—eyes trembling
over the soul of her child. And the hands! Don’t
you feel at any second they may move? One might
come tomorrow and find them any-other-where. Motion—touch—a
quickening sense of protection. Use the
place as a shelter against the rain! Damnable! There’s
just the same amazing mobility in the expression of La
Jaconde—at the Louvre, but with this difference. The
Virgin”—he pointed again at the picture—“and Monna
Lisa, the woman who saw the world through eyes
of understanding which curled her lips to humour. A
courtesan some folks say she was—not unlikely—inevitable
almost! Takes a courtesan to contrive a measured
expression like that. Lord! if a good woman could
understand as a courtesan <span class='it'>must</span> understand, what a
superwoman she would be! Intellect springs from
knowledge of the flesh, and is sunk in it too—more often
the latter. The revelation of one sex to another is the
well-head of all learning. Passion of the soul is the reaction
of bodily passion—must be—<span class='it'>is</span>. What is it
Pater says about Monna Lisa?—‘Represents what, in
a thousand years, man had come to desire.’ True too!
Even a fool would admit that. There’s a fleeting look
in the eyes and the mouth that adjusts itself to every
line of thought—gives an answer to every question—a
compassion for every sin—an impetus to all betterment.
Been to the Louvre? Know the picture?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Wynne, rather ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Gad a’mighty! then you’ve plenty to learn,
and the sooner you start the better. What are you—art
student or what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to be a writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seventeen and a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then learn to paint first. There are no schools for
writers, and painting’ll teach you more than all the
libraries in the world. Teach you values—that’s the
hinge of all learning in art—values! Relative values.
The worth of this as compared with that. Teach you
line—the infinite variety of line—the tremendous responsibility
of line—the humour—the severity of line.
Teach you nature—the goddess from whom all beauty
is drawn, and whose lightest touch has more mystery
in it than all the creations of man. That’s what you
want to do. No good trying to write till you’re nearing
thirty—abouts. Learn on canvas how to ink your paper
thoughts. Pack your bag and go to Paris.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I will,” exclaimed Wynne. “Where—where
should I go when I get there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere—Julian—Calarossi. The Quartier is full
of ’em. Make for the Boule Miche, and stop the first
boy with a beard. He’ll tell you where to go.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span><h1>PART THREE<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PARIS</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At nine o’clock next evening a slightly confused
Wynne Rendall was seeking a cab midst the din
and clatter of the Gare St. Lazare. He had
escaped the escort of several insidious gentlemen who
offered their services as “Guides,” and spoke suggestively
of Corybantine revels they were prepared to exhibit.
Wynne had been warned by an amiable Customs
official to have nothing to do with “zes blerdy scoundrills,”
so he was able to reply to their English solicitations,
“Pas ce soir, merci,” and move on in the press
of crowds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He succeeded in attracting the attention of a very
aged cab-driver, who controlled two white steeds, of
even greater age, with a pair of scarlet reins. Him he
addressed in his best school French:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Je desire trouver un hotel très petit et pas trop
cher,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver seemed at some difficulty to understand,
but when finally he succeeded in doing so he bade Wynne
climb inside, and, gathering up his reins, shouted
a frenzied command to the horses. Seemingly these
beasts were unaffected by his cries, for they moved
away in the stateliest fashion; whereupon the driver
rose to his feet and laid about him with a whip like
any Roman charioteer. This produced the desired result,
and the vehicle, swaying perilously, thundered over
the cobbles of the station yard and out into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is magnificent,” said Wynne. “Oh, gorgeous!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes feasted on the broad boulevards—the <span class='it'>cafés</span>,
with their little tables set upon the pavement beneath
the gay striped awning—the unfamiliar cosmopolitan
crowds who jostled along or sat sipping their syros and
bocks at pleasant ease. Also it was very wonderful to
be driving on the wrong side of the road and apparently
ignoring all traffic laws. Once a gendarme with
a long, clattering sword held up his hand to bid them
stop, but him the driver ignored, beyond a sharp
rattle of criticism as they brushed by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the corner of the Rue St. Honoré a <span class='it'>fiacre</span> in front
knocked a man off his bicycle, and proceeded as though
nothing had happened. The unfortunate cyclist picked
himself up and started in pursuit, leaving his bicycle
lying in the highway. A motor bus, considering such an
obstacle unworthy of changing its course to avoid, ran
over it, crushing the frame and rims, and Wynne’s
cab, following behind, did likewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nobody seemed to care. Passers-by scarcely wasted
a glance over the affair. A desire to cheer possessed
Wynne. It seemed he had arrived at the City of Harlequinade,
where the wildest follies were counted to be
wise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further down the road a fight was in progress. No
blows were exchanged, but the disputants grabbed and
clawed at each other’s clothing. They ripped out neckties
and tore the buttons from waistcoats. They stamped
upon and kicked each other’s hats—pockets were
wrenched from coats, and shirt-tails sprang unexpectedly
to view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne could not help thinking how funny it would be
if Wallace were to appear in Wimbledon High Street
with a battered silk hat and his shirt-tail flapping over
his breeches. There was humour in this fight which
seemed to justify it—not blood and staggering figures,
such as one saw outside the publichouses at home on a
Saturday night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne blessed the old gentleman of the National
Gallery who had inspired him to come to Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They passed a great <span class='it'>magasin</span> with blazed arch lights,
and turned up a tiny street to the left. Wynne caught
a glimpse of its name as the cab turned the corner.
“Rue Croix des Petits Champs.” Then the vehicle
stopped abruptly—so abruptly that the nearside horse
fell to his knees and nearly dragged the driver from
the box, who marked his disapproval by liberal use
of the whip. Order being restored, he pointed to a big
arched doorway and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Voilà! Voilà!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Wynne alighted and demanded:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Comme bien?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cinq francs quatre-vingt-cinq.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was unaccustomed to French money, and
the centimes conveyed nothing to him. He proffered
four francs and was amazed at the flow of incomprehensible
invective which followed. It was impossible
to argue at anything approaching that speed, so he
held up his palm with some silver in it and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alors prenez ce que vous voulez.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The driver accordingly appropriated eight francs, and
with a cry of “ ’Voir et merci,” whipped up his horses
and vanished into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne subsequently learned that the fare should
have been about one shilling and threepence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He entered the arched gates and found himself in a
small courtyard with a lighted door at the further end.
Above this was written, “Hotel du Monde et Madagascar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea of referring to Madagascar as though it
were a satellite of the world pleased his sense of humour
and warmed his heart toward the new abode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foyer at the hotel was quite small, and there was
a little office, on the immediate right of the entrance,
in which sat a sweet-looking old lady dressed in black,
and wearing a beautifully laundered cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne gave her good evening, stated that he wanted
a room, “très bon marché,” and told her his name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Et moi je suis Rosalie,” returned the little concierge,
with the sweetest smile imaginable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly he could have a room—it was on the fifth
floor, and cost but twenty francs a month. That he
would like it she was sure, since it was “clair, propre
et tout ce qu’il faut.” She would ring for Benoit, who
was “un garçon bien gentil,” although suffering from
“mal é la poitrine,” which would carry him off all too
soon. “Qui, c’est triste!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Benoit’s appearance, when eventually he arrived, did
not give rise to any immediate anxiety regarding his
health. He was a big and cheerful man, beside whom
Wynne felt painfully insignificant. Taking possession
of the bag, Benoit led the way up many flights of stairs,
until at last they arrived at the fifth floor. Here he
threw open a door and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Voilà! N’est-ce pas?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s reply, “C’est de luxe,” amused Benoit
greatly, who sat on the bed to enjoy a hearty laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the bag was being unpacked, Benoit supplied
information regarding Parisian life. Thus Wynne
learnt that the average boarder in small French hotels
went out for his meals and his bath. By this means
either one or the other could be taken at the convenience
of the individual, who was therefore in no way constrained
to be at a certain place at any specified hour.
Wynne inquired how far it was to the Quartier Latin,
and was greatly delighted to learn that ten minutes’
walk would land him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many students from the ateliers lodged at the hotel,
he discovered, some of whom were “bien gentil,” and
others “méchant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aprés le Bal Quatres Arts! O c’était terrible!”
He, Benoit, was constrained to prevent a certain young
Englishman, who habitually was “tout à fait milord,”
from importing to his apartment a lady dressed as Britannia,
whom he claimed as his bride. It was undoubtedly
very droll, and he was sympathetic, but the good
name of the house came first, and since no marriage
lines were available, husband and wife were forced to
celebrate their nuptials apart. Doubtless the young
man was carried away by patriotism, but if the excellent
“Madame” had heard of such goings on she would have
been in a fine rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further advices were given as to where Wynne
would do well to seek his food. He would find excellent
hospitality “chez Bouillon Aristide” at the corner,
and a little further down the Rue St. Honoré was a
creamery whose chocolate and croissons would compare
with those set upon the table of the President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He urged Wynne to avoid sliding on the polished
floor of his bedroom, since the practice provided him
with additional labour in the mornings. Also he volunteered
the remark that the room was popular because it
was very amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne liked the room, but could not at the time
comprehend in what sense the word amusing could be
associated with it. When he awoke the following morning
an explanation arose, for his ears were filled with
the sound of girls’ voices singing a merry song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Opening his eyes he observed through the window
an apartment some twenty feet away on the other side
of the courtyard. Herein sat perhaps a dozen little
workgirls, plaiting and combing long switches of false
hair. They were employés of a perruquier, and cheerful,
light-hearted souls they appeared to be. When he
sat up in bed they greeted him with the friendliest
gaiety, giving thanks that their fears that he might be
dead were not realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne felt a little embarrassed having to make his
toilet in these circumstances. He remained between the
sheets indecisively until forced to rise by the friendly
chaffery from opposite. Then he grabbed his clothes
from the chair and ran the gauntlet to the corner of
the room, where he might dress without being observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This manœuvre excited gusts of merriment, in which
he found himself joining very heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, why should one mind dressing before an
audience? It was ridiculous to be super-modest over
such trifles. He realized with a start that his own
stock of unconventionalism was thoroughly outclassed
by these simple little midinettes, and this being so, he
at once conceived for them a very profound esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, with a hairbrush in one hand and his
braces trailing behind him, he stepped upon the tiny
balcony and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bon jour. Je pense que vous êtes très, très douce
les toutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cordial reception accorded to this sentiment encouraged
him to further efforts. He found, however,
that his stock of French was insufficient for the needs
of the occasion. After a laborious endeavour to express
appreciation for their sunny broad-minded temperaments
and to include a few words stating that his mission in
life was to inculcate a similar breadth of mind to the
hide-bound pedants who infested the world, he was compelled
to stop for lack of the material to proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His merry audience, in spite of having failed to
understand a single word, cheered the speech very generously,
and blew him a cloud of aerial kisses.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall took his chocolate and immersed his
roll therein with all the skill of a Parisian, and later,
in a very rapturous frame of mind, crossed the Seine
by the Pont des Arts and made his way to the Rue du
Dragon. He had no difficulty in discovering the Atelier
Julien, and addressing himself to a bearded and aproned
old gentleman who sat on a high stool in a very small
office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had feared there might be difficulty in gaining
admission, since he could claim no previous experience
of the plastic arts, but in this his misgivings proved
groundless. It was merely a matter of paying one’s
fee—a small fee at that—and taking one’s place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Asked if he had any choice of masters, he shook his
head. He was placed therefore under the guardianship
of Le Maître Jean Paul Laurens, a man “both
strong and brilliant,” whose studio was on the first
floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since he desired to spend the day seeing Paris, and
purchasing colours and canvas, Wynne decided he would
not start work until the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bien; demain matin à huit heures! Très bien. Au
’voir.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was splendid to reflect that he was a full-blown
student of the Quartier, thought Wynne, as with ringing
steps he swung along the narrow thoroughfares. He
wished Uncle Clem had been there to witness his glory.
Never before had he felt so confident of his own personality.
Rivulets of water danced and chattered along the
gutters reflecting the gladness of his mood—the sun
shone gloriously on the tall white houses. Quaint old
men with baskets of merchandise piped beseechingly on
tiny horns. Thousands of purple-dyed eggs filled the
shop windows, and the wonderful, everchanging, raffish,
homely crowds chattered, gesticulated and hurried along
in ceaseless streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was possessed with a foolish desire to shake
hands with every one he met, and tell them all about
himself; to explain why he had come, and to give them
a glimpse of the workings of his many-sided nature. A
measure of common sense dissuaded him from so doing,
but he sang as he walked, and expanded his narrow
chest to its fullest capacity. Presently he found himself
by the riverside, and hovered awhile over the book-sellers’
stalls perched on the stone copings of the embankment.
At one of these he bought a translation of
Shakespeare’s works, an old volume of Balzac, and some
paper-bound copies of the plays of Molière. It was the
first time he had rummaged among books, and the experience
was delightful. The mere touch of them sent a
thrill of learning through his being.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For awhile he hovered by the riverside watching the
energetic steamboats—the sober barges—and the great
floating warehouses moored by the tow-path. Everywhere
were people sketching—placid and preoccupied.
No crowds of curious urchins jostled around them with
stupid comments, as was always the case at home when
any one had the temerity to bring their colour-box into
the open day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paris respected its artists, and gave them as great
seclusion out of doors as in their own studios. Sombre
sportsmen, rodded and camp-stooled, lined the banks and
strove to catch the elusive gudgeon. It seemed as though
their attention was centred anywhere but upon the float.
Their eyes rested dreamily on the spanned arches of Pont
Neuf or the flying buttresses of Notre Dame, while invisible
fish in the green waters beneath worried the bait
from the hook with perfect immunity from danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the island of Notre Dame Wynne directed his steps,
and spent an hour of sheer delight with imagination
let loose. Romance breathed in the air around him, and
memory of dead things sprang to life. He pictured
himself back in Dumas’ days—with king’s men and
cardinals—swashbuckling on the footway—with masked
ladies flitting into dark doorways, and the tinkle
of blade against blade from some courtyard near at
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Chance led him to enter a low, stone building by one
of the bridges. All manner of men and women passed
in and out of this place, and Wynne followed the general
lead. There was a glass compartment across the far
side of the hall, before which a large crowd was assembled.
A nursemaid wheeling a perambulator, and a
group of blue-smocked, pipe-smoking ouvriers hid from
view what the case contained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exhibits, whatever they might be, were clearly
very popular. Wynne reflected that probably they were
Napoleonic relics, or maybe the crown jewels, when a
rift in the crowd betrayed the fact that the case was
full of dead men. With heads tilted at shy and foolish
angles, with bodies lolling limply against the sloped
marble slabs, the corpses of the Seine bleared stupidly
at the quick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time Wynne had looked on the face
of the dead, and the sight chilled him with a faint, freezing
sickness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God, how awful!” he muttered, and turned to
go, but the way before him was barred by fresh arrivals.
“I want to get out,” he cried, but no one heeded him.
He began to struggle, when a firm hand fell on his
shoulder, and a voice, speaking with a Southern American
accent, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Calm down, son. What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne looked up and saw a tall, broad-shouldered
man smiling upon him. He wore a blue serge shirt, a
pair of sailor’s breeches, and no hat. His black, sleek
hair hung loosely over his left temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s horrible,” said Wynne. “I want to get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yer wrong,” came the answer. “Yer wan’ to stop.
The spirit of Paris abides in this place. There’s no intensive
life without an intensive death. Only when they
come here do they realize how very much alive they are.
Sometimes I believe the Morgue is the greatest tonic in
this city. Now jest pull up and we’ll step round the
cases together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yer not afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but—it seems so callous, and—I want to live—and
do great things—wonders. I don’t want to stare
at a row of corpses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a fellow there”—he nodded his head toward
the case—“who was an artist. He wanted to live and
perform wonders too. Then he found out that he
couldn’t—found out that a dozen idle, do-nothing fellows
could outclass him at every turn. What happens? He
puts a brick in pocket and jumps. Seems to me, with
your ideas, you might learn something from the page
of those cold features.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Wynne; “lead away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They joined the crowd that slowly filed past the silent
watchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I saw them,” he said, as they turned once
more toward the door. “I never realized before what
full-stop meant. It makes one feel the need to get on—and
on. Death is so horribly conclusive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a breath of air gratefully as they came into
the sunlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cure for slackers, eh?” said the American.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—rather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a pleasant fellow, the American, and volunteered
to share a table at lunch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Painting student?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m making a start tomorrow at Julien’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then pay for your drink when the Massier introduces
himself, and if you know a rorty song sing it for
all you’re worth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After lunch he helped Wynne buy colours, brushes,
and a beautiful walnut palette, then wished him luck
and departed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They never met again. Paris is the place of quick
friendships and equally quick partings. Races lose
their characteristic shyness under the Paris sun.
Strangers accost each other and join in day-long or
night-long festivities, exchange their most intimate
thoughts, and finally go their ways without even so much
as asking each other’s names.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne arrived at the Atelier Jean Paul Laurens at
a quarter to the hour of eight <span style='font-size:smaller'>A. M.</span> He was the first
comer, and had a moment’s leisure to survey his surroundings.
The studio itself was not large, and as high
as the arm could reach the walls were plastered, generations
deep, with palette scrapings. Above in great profusion
were studies from the nude, heads and charcoal
drawings in every possible mood of form and light. To
Wynne, hitherto accustomed to regard paintings as
pictures, these canvases struck a note of brutal coarseness,
offending his æsthetic sensibilities. They seemed no
more than men and women stripped of their clothing and
indecently exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! I won’t paint like that,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a great pile of easels in the corner he selected
one and disposed it a few feet away from the model’s
throne; which done, he set his palette with an infinite
number of small dabs of colour. He thrust a few
brushes through the thumb-hole, and was ready to make
a start when the time arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently a little Italian girl, with heavy gold rings
in her ears, and a coloured kerchief over her head, came
in and nodded a greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nouveau?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oui,” replied Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled agreeably, and seating herself on the
throne kicked her shoes behind a screen and pulled off
her stockings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O-ooo!” she shivered, “c’est pas chaud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded toward the stove, and Wynne was glad of
the opportunity to put on some coal, since he was conscious
of some small uneasiness, alone and unoccupied
while the maiden disrobed. He took as long as possible,
and when he had finished discovered that she had
finished too, and was calling upon him to provide her
with a “couverture.” This he sought and handed to
her, not entirely without embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merci, Bébé,” said the Italian, and draped the old
curtain around herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the passage outside came the sound of many
footsteps—a clamour of voices, and a moment later some
twenty students clattered into the studio, with others
at their heels. They were men of all ages and every
nationality—some dressed as typical art students, others
as conventionally attired as any young gentleman from
Bond Street. An impulse which they shared in common
was to make a noise, and in this they achieved a very
high standard of perfection. A great variety of sounds
were produced, mostly patterned from the fowl-run or
the asses’ stall. One serious-minded and bearded boy
devoted his ingenuity to reproducing the noise of a
motor horn; while another, leaping to the model’s
throne, hailed the dawn like any chanticleer. Espying
Wynne’s beautifully white canvas perched upon its
easel, a red-headed Alsatian flung a tabouret which
swept all before it, and sent the new palette planing to
the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil do you mean by that?” cried Wynne,
and was told to “Shut up, you silly ass. Don’t ask for
trouble,” by an English voice at the back of the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this moment a very precise little Frenchman
stepped forward and made a bow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moi je suis le Massier,” he announced, and asked
if Wynne were prepared to stand a drink to the students.
Twelve francs was the sum required—payable in advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The money was produced, whereat every one, including
the model, who had borrowed a long painter’s
coat for the occasion, rushed from the studio. Half the
crowd became wedged in the doorway, and the other
half fell down the stairs <span class='it'>en masse</span>. Wynne was swept
along by the tidal wave at the rear, and trod on many
prostrate pioneers before swinging out into the Rue du
Dragon. There was a small café fifty yards distant, and
thither they raced, sweeping every one from the pavements
as they ran. Further jostling ensued at the doors
of the café, but finally every one struggled through and
found accommodation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chair was set upon a table and Wynne invited to
occupy it. This he did with very great satisfaction and
a kingly feeling. Busy waiters below hurried round
with trays, bearing glasses of black coffee, and a very
innocuous fluid known as “grog Americaine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all had been served the Massier called upon the
“nouveau” to give a song, and reminded him that failure
to do so might result in unhappy consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Wynne stood upon the chair, with his head touching
the ceiling, and sang several questionable limericks
at the top of his voice. Hardly a soul understood the
words, but from the spirit of their delivery they judged
them to be indecent and bawdy, and as such very acceptable
to hear. Moreover, there was a refrain in
which all were able to join, and this in itself readily
popularized the effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Massier personally complimented the vocalist, and
suggested that the occasion was almost sufficient to
justify a barricade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cries were raised that nothing short of the barricade
could be contemplated, and in an instant all the chairs
and tables from the café were cast outside into the
street. Skilled at their work, the barricaders set one
table against the other with chairs before them. The
company then seated itself and began to sing. Ladies
from adjoining houses leaned out and threw smiles of
encouragement, and the traffic in both directions ceased
to flow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many and strange were the songs sung, and they dealt
with life and adventure of a coarse but frisky kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the passers-by learned what befell an officer
who came across the Rhine, a sturdy fellow with an eye
for a maid, and a compelling way with him to wit.
Some there were who glowered disapprovingly at this
morning madness, but more generally the audience were
sympathetic, and yielded to the student the right of
levity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All would have gone well but for a surly dray-driver,
who, wearying of the hold-up, urged his hairies into the
midmost table with a view to breaking the barricade.
This churlish act excited the liveliest activity. The
horses were drawn from the shafts and led forthwith
into a small greengrocer’s shop, where they feasted
royally upon the carrots and swedes basketed in
abundance about them. The owner of the shop and the
driver raised their voices in protest, and their cries attracted
the attention of the patron of the café. This
good man, supported by three waiters, came forth and
argued that the jest had gone far enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In so doing he was ill-advised, for in Paris a kill-joy
invariably prejudices his own popularity. Some
of the students formed a cordon about the good man
and his staff, while others seized the chairs and tables
and piled them on the tops of the waiting vehicles.
This done they started the horses with cries and blows,
and a moment later the furniture was careering up the
street in all directions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“C’est fini,” said the Massier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cordon broke, Monsieur le Patron and his garçons
were away in pursuit, and the students, headed by the
bare-footed Italian girl in her paint-smeared jacket,
turned once more to their labours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was almost exhausted with laughter. It
seemed impossible such revels could be conducted by
perfectly sober men before half-past eight in the morning.
Perhaps strangest of all was the suddenness with
which the robes of gaiety were discarded, for ten minutes
later each man was at his easel setting out his palette
as soberly as a city clerk plays dominoes during the
luncheon hour.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It should be stated that Wynne Rendall showed small
skill as a painter. He approached the task with a
pleasant conviction that he would at least rival if not
excel the ordinary run of students. At school he had
been able to achieve clever little caricatures of masters
and boys, and he had thought to draw from life would
be a simpler matter altogether. To his chagrin he discovered
that he was not able even to place the figure
roughly upon a canvas. He realized the intention of
the pose, but his efforts to convey it were futile and
grotesque.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With jealous irritation he observed how the other
students dashed in the rough constructive features of a
figure with sure sense of proportion and animation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wha’ are ye trying to do?” inquired a Scotch lad,
who had abandoned his work for the pleasure of watching
Wynne’s confusion. “Mon, it’s awfu’. Have ye
no drawn from the antique?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was not disposed to give himself away, although
the words made him hot with shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every one has his own method,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A’mitted, but there’s no meethod in yon. Stand
awa’ a meenit.” And before Wynne had time to protest
he struck a dozen red lines upon the canvas which
gave an almost instantaneous likeness to the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Leave it alone,” said Wynne. “It isn’t yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I need hairdly say I’m glad. Now look ye here.
Ye know naything, and a leetle ceevil attention will
profit ye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not pay the slightest heed to Wynne’s sulky
rejoinder, but, sucking at his pipe, continued to work
on the canvas with great dexterity and skill. Presently
he wearied of the occupation, and Wynne came
back to his own with a somewhat chastened spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is an understood thing in the ateliers that every
one criticizes every one else, and supports his theories
by painting on the canvas he may be discussing. Before
the day was out half a dozen different men left
their mark on Wynne’s study. The most irritating
feature about this practice was the coincidence that they
always obliterated some little passage with which he
was pleased. To quote one instance, he had succeeded
rather happily in the treatment of an eye, imparting to
it a sparkle and lustre that gave him profound satisfaction.
He could have screamed with rage when the
red-headed Alsatian, dipping his thumb in some raw
umber, blotted it out, saying sweetly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not that it is an eye—it is a shadow that it
should be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A similar experience occurred when, a week later,
the great Jean Paul Laurens halted in amazement and
disgust before his performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” said he, “is a series of trivial incidents, of
disjointed details! To we artists the human figure is
a mass of light and shade. It is not made up of legs
and hands, and breasts, and ears and teeth. No—by
the good God, no!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which he seized a brush and scrabbled a quantity
of flake white over the entire surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” he said. “It is finished.” And passed on
to the next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thinking the matter over in bed that night Wynne
realized he had learnt a great and valuable lesson:
breadth of view—visualizing life as a whole. It was
knowledge that could be applied to almost everything.
Detail merely existed as part of the whole, but the whole
was not arrived at by assembling detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same would apply, he perceived, to every art,
to business, too, and to life in general. He began to
understand how it was possible for people like Wallace
and his father to have their place in the scheme of
things. They ceased to exist as individual items, brought
into undue prominence by enforced propinquity, but became
parts of a great machinery whose functions were
too mighty to comprehend. These were the shadows
which gave tone-value to the high-lights. They were
vital and essential, and without them there would be no
contrast, no variety, nothing but flat levels—dull and
marshy—and never a hill on the horizon showing purple
in the morning sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must learn this trade of painting,” said Wynne,
“it’s the short road to all knowledge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung himself into the work with an energy truly
remarkable. From early morning till midnight he
battled with the craft, and thought and talked of nothing
else. In the cafés, where students met and thrashed
out their thousand ideas, Wynne was well bethought,
for although his skill with a brush was small he could
advance and support a theory with the liveliest talker
in the Quartier. His success in argument was, perhaps,
not altogether of advantage to his immortal soul, since
it led him to cultivate a cynical attitude toward most
affairs. He very readily became conversant with the
works of the Masters, old and new, and praised or attacked
them with great impartiality. Preferably he
would detract from accepted geniuses, and deliver the
most scathing criticisms against pictures before which
mankind had prostrated itself for centuries. One day
he would admit of the value of no artist save Manet,
and another would accuse him of possessing neither skill
nor artistry, but merely “a singularly adroit knack of
expressing vulgarity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not attempt to be honest in regard to his points
of view, being perfectly satisfied so long as he could
hold a controversial opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not infrequently high words would result from these
discussions, and on one occasion a table was overset,
glasses smashed, and a chair flung. Police arrived on
the scene, and Wynne and three companions spent the
night in a lockup. This he did not mind in the least,
and continued to air his views in the small hours of the
morning until threatened with solitary confinement unless
he desisted.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the tenth week after his arrival in Paris, Wynne’s
money gave out. He had not bothered to consider what
he should do when this happened, and as a result poverty
seized him unprepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To do him justice he did not bother in the least as
to the future of his bodily welfare, but was distressed
beyond expression at the thought of abandoning his
studies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wild idea possessed him to sell some of his future
years for a few more terms at the studio. He even
went to the length of discussing the project with the
Massier. This gentleman, however, shook his head
dubiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impossible,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said Wynne. “I’ll give two-thirds of all
I earn for the next three years to any one who’ll finance
me now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No doubt; but, monsieur, philanthropists are
few in the Quartier—and your painting!” He made
an expressive gesture. “Your paintings will never
be sold. He who gave the money would see it again—never!
I am sorry—it is sad—but what would
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne turned away heavy at heart and angry, and
next morning his place before the throne was vacant.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Of all cities in the world Paris is the least hospitable
to a bankrupt. It does not ask a man to be rich, and it
does not mind if he be poor, for the great Parisian heart
is warm to either state, but for the man who is destitute
there is no place in its affections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Quartier art student is an easy-going fellow in
most directions, who will share his wine and his love
with amiable impartiality, but he is proof against the
borrower’s craft, and will do anything rather than lend
money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of this circumstance Wynne was already aware, and
in a sense was glad that it should be so. He was not
of the kind who borrow, but had it been easy to negotiate
a loan his awkward plight might have weighed against
the maintenance of his ideals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he walked up the Rue Buonaparte, his colour-box
swinging in his hand, he reflected that the moment
had come to prove his fibre. Between himself and
starvation was a sum amounting to one franc fifty
centimes, barely enough to purchase a couple of modest
meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This time the day after tomorrow I shall be very
hungry,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not alarmed at the prospect—and, indeed, he
regarded it with a queer sense of excitement. By some
twist of imagination he conceived that an adventurous
credit was reflected upon himself by the very emptiness
of his pockets. Tradition showed that most of the
world’s great artists had passed through straitened circumstances,
wherefore it was only right and proper he
should do otherwise. Certainly there was no very manifest
advantage in starving, but it would be pleasant to
reflect that one <span class='it'>had</span> starved. Almost he wished he could
banish the still haunting flavour of the chocolate he had
drunk at his <span class='it'>petit déjeuner</span>, and feel the pangs of hunger
tormenting his vitals. He consoled himself with the
thought that these would occur soon enough. In the
meantime it would be well to consider what line of action
he proposed to take. The impulse to do a sketch and
carry it to market he dismissed at once. The schools
had taught him that whatever virtues his artistry might
possess, they were not of a saleable kind. It was therefore
folly to waste his money in buying a good canvas
which would undoubtedly be spoilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good,” he argued. “No good at all. I must do
something that I can do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the embankment he was accosted by the keeper of
a bookstall which of late he had patronized freely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have here a copy of the verses of Sully Prudhomme,”
said the man, “and the price is but one franc.
Such a chance will scarcely arrive again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was sheer bravado, but Wynne bought the little
volume without so much as an attempt to beat down
the price. He felt no end of a fine fellow as he pocketed
it and strolled away. Yet, curiously enough, he had
not gone far before a panic seized him and he longed
to rush back and beg for his money to be returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s silly,” he told himself—“cowardly.” His
hand stole to his pocket and took comfort from the feel
of the fifty centime piece which remained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were really a man I’d spend that too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And spend it he did, but on a long loaf of stale bread
which he brought back with him to the hotel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Benoit at his interminable occupation of
polishing the bedroom floor. This duty was performed
by means of a flat brush strapped to the sole of the
boot. The excellent fellow, while so employed, resembled
a chicken scratching in straw for oats. Polishing
had become a second nature to Benoit. He polished
while he made beds, he polished while he emptied slops,
he polished while he indulged in his not infrequent spells
of religious rumination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was in this latter state of mind Wynne found him,
and for want of a better confidant explained his unfortunate
predicament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Benoit,” he said, “I am ruined—utterly ruined and
penniless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That,” replied the garçon, “is a pity, since I had
had in mind that on the morrow you would be giving
me five francs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is the custom to give five francs to the garçon at
the beginning of each month.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your chances of getting it, Benoit, are very remote.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is to be hoped you will, then, be able to give me
ten in the month which follows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I pray that it may be so. In the meantime what
am I to do that I may subsist?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is a matter which rests with the good God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suing your pardon, I prefer to believe that it rests
with me, Benoit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is inferior! I remark that you already possess
bread.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is the smaller part of my possessions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the larger, m’sieur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brains, Benoit—brains.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For myself I had rather have of the bread, believing
it to be the more substantial blessing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which proves, Benoit, that you speak without consideration.
A fool and his loaf are soon parted, but a
wise man has that within his head which will stock a
bakery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it prove so with you, m’sieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand thanks. But, to return to our muttons,
how am I to use my brains to best advantage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By considering the lives of the saints, m’sieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pious answer, Benoit, but I seek to use them to
more profitable account. When I am relieved of the
immediate anxiety of prematurely meeting these personages,
I shall doubtless be better able to direct my
thoughts toward them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can only repeat, m’sieur, that in divine consideration
lies the province of the brain. If it be the body
you desire to profit, then, beyond doubt, it is your
hands must seek employment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no skill of the hands, Benoit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no great skill required, m’sieur, to carry a
basket at Les Arles.”<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>“I urge you, Benoit, to avoid words of folly. Am
I of the fibre to lift crates from a market cart? And
if I were, do you suppose I could adjust my intellect to
so clumsy a calling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is better, m’sieur, to engage upon a humble task
than to wallow with the gudgeon of the Seine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pooh! Benoit, am I a likely suicide?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Given no meat, a man will drink betimes over-deeply
of the water.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer and memory of a certain grotesque figure
in the Morgue gave Wynne to pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a cold comforter,” he said. “Have you no
happier suggestion to offer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I speak from knowledge, m’sieur. If you are destitute
you must be content with the smallest blessings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have intellect, Benoit, in larger measure than
most. Is there no market for intellect in this city of
Paris?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be better intellects than yours that sleep
without a roof in Paris tonight. Why should you, a
stranger, look to France to buy your thoughts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because France alone, of all countries, holds out the
hand of welcome to Art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may be so—and it may be in so doing she fills
her own coffers. These are matters which I do not
understand, but I know well, and well enough, that the
stranger may learn an art in this city, but he cannot
sell it here. M’sieur, when your bread is eaten I would
advise that you go to Les Arles and offer your hands.
There is always a value for hands, even though it be
but very small, and maybe, by using them, you would
in the end find profit for the brain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum!” said Wynne despondently, “of all men you
are the most cheerless.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But indeed no. If my mind was melancholy it was
but to suit an occasion of some sadness. Let us, if you
will, speak of lighter affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But since that line of conversation inevitably led to
descriptions of <span class='it'>jeunes filles</span> who at one time or another
had confided their affections over-deeply to Benoit’s
keeping, Wynne declined the invitation, and, picking
up his cap, descended the stairs and walked towards the
Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discussion had done little to brighten his horizon,
and he was oppressed with misgivings as he passed
through the streets. Obviously it was absurd to attach
importance to the words of an ignorant <span class='it'>valet de
chambre</span>. On the other hand, there was a degree of
probability in what he had said which could not be
lightly dismissed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly an idea possessed him, and his spirits rose
with a leap. It occurred from the memory of a remark
made by the patron of a <span class='it'>brasserie</span> in the Boule Miche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, monsieur,” he had said, “it is long since we
entertained a customer who spoke with such inspiration
on so many subjects.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The remark had been made after a long sitting in
which Wynne had held the attention of a dozen students
for several hours while he threw off his red-hot views
on art and life in general. As a result the little absorbent
mats, upon which the glasses stand, and which mark
the number of drinks each man has taken, had piled
high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I measure the value of conversation,” the patron had
continued, “by the amount of bock which is consumed,
and tonight has surpassed all previous records. I trust
m’sieur will return many times, and place me even more
deeply in his debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Heaven,” thought Wynne, “I believe he’d pay
me a salary to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So greatly did the belief take hold of him that, unthinkingly,
he sprang upon a tram, only to spring off
again with the recollection that he had not the wherewithal
to pay the fare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. le Patron greeted Wynne with amiable courtesy,
and invited him to be seated, asking at the same time
what manner of drink would be agreeable to his taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want nothing,” said Wynne, “but the privilege of
a few moments’ conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will be delightful; then we will sit together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not know if you remember an evening a short
while ago when I was here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is, indeed, one of my pleasantest recollections.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On that occasion you were good enough to observe
that my conversation resulted in a marked increase in
your sales of liquor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And indeed, m’sieur, it was no less than the truth.
The nimbleness of m’sieur’s wit, the charm of his address,
and the adroitness of his argument are only comparable
to those of that most admirable Bohemian, Monsieur
Robinson, who, I have no doubt, is well known in
England.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably,” said Wynne, “although I have never
heard of him. But to return. I have come here today
to make you a business proposition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is very kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I am obliged to do something of the
sort owing to financial difficulties which have suddenly
arisen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tch-tch-tch! How very provoking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was noticeable, however, that the brow of M. le
Patron had clouded, and his sympathy was not wholly
genuine. Wynne, however, was paying more attention
to himself than to the attitude of his hearer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I was about to suggest is this. Encouraged
by your words of a month ago, I am willing to occupy
a table at your café each night, and to discourse upon
all the burning questions of the day. In return for this
small service and the undoubted credit it will bring to
the establishment, I put forward that you should offer
me the hospitality of free meals and a trifle of twenty
francs a week for my expenses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He delivered the speech with an air of cordiality and
condescension designed to introduce the offer in the most
favourable light. Hearing his words as he spoke them
there remained small doubt in his mind that the astute
Frenchman would embrace the opportunity with gratitude.
In this, however, he was sadly at fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M’sieur is an original,” came the answer; “but he
can hardly be serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am entirely serious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I fear that, with due regret, I must decline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Decline? But—but the notion was originally your
own. I should not have suggested it had it not been
that you⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon, m’sieur, I see the fault was mine, and my
words evidently placed m’sieur under a misapprehension.
He will readily perceive, however, that, as patron,
it is my duty to be affable, and, although it desolates
me to confess so much, it has been my long habit to
express to all my more loquacious guests precisely the
same sentiments which I addressed to m’sieur on the
evening of which he spoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! has it?” said Wynne, rather dully. “Then
there’s no more to be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas! no. It is sad, but what would you? Au
revoir, m’sieur.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Au ’voir.” He moved a pace away, then turned.
“I suppose you haven’t any sort of job you could offer
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unhappily!” said the patron, and turned to welcome
a new arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t give up,” muttered Wynne, as he walked
moodily down the busy boulevard. “After all, it was
only a first attempt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not sleep very easily that night. He
lay with his eyes open in the dark and wondered what
would befall him—where he would be in a week’s time—if
what Benoit had said were true. These and a
thousand perplexing fears and fancies raced and jostled
through his brain. Presently one big thought rose and
dominated all the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mustn’t forget any of this. It is all valuable—all
part of the lesson—part of the training—part of the
price which a climber has to pay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he thought of The Cedars, and of Wallace
setting forth to the City after a “good” breakfast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wallace would have “sensible” boots, and would
carry an umbrella. Wallace would exchange views on
the subject of politics or chip-carving with other folk
as sober as himself. Wallace would smirk at his employer,
and would eat a Cambridge sausage for his lunch.
Wallace would go to bed at 10.30 <span style='font-size:smaller'>P. M.</span> that he might
be ready to do these things again on the morrow. With
this reflection there came to Wynne a very glorious satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t change with you,” he said, and turning
on his side fell into a comfortable and easy sleep.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was shining brightly when he awoke, and all
the little midinettes were in full song.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne sat up in bed and ate a piece of his bread
and drank a glass of water. Asked why he did so, he
cheerfully replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Moi, je suis ruiné.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereupon the maidens laughed very heartily and
said he was a droll.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had become quite used to the little audience
across the way and scarcely took them into consideration.
Women, as such, made little or no impression
upon him. He liked them well enough, but never cared
to better his knowledge or acquaintance with any with
whom he had come into contact. Physically they made
not the slightest appeal to him—his senses were inert
toward the impulse of sex, and he was given to criticize
contemptuously those of his companions who staked their
emotions in the ways of passion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do not imagine I suffer from moral convictions,”
he would say; “but, according to my views, you attach
an importance to these matters out of all relation to
their value.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentence had inflamed to a very high degree the
student to whom it was addressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool! Fish!” he had shouted, by way of argument;
and again, “Fish! Fish!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a running fire of semi-serious sympathy Wynne
dressed himself and went out. In a sense he was a little
distressed to sacrifice his accustomed cup of early morning
chocolate—but this, he argued, was a matter of small
concern. A plethora of victuals stagnates the mind, and
on this day he had every reason to desire a clear head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Elysée Gardens he found a bench and contracted
his brow in meditation. What, he ruminated,
were the essentials required to gain a livelihood? Obviously
there was a place for every one in this world,
or mankind would not survive the ordeal of birth.
There was a place for people of every kind of intelligence—a
glance at the passers-by proved it, and proved
that even the stupid may sometimes prosper. This being
so, it was obvious that the wise must prosper even
more greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I got to sell?” he asked himself. “What
have I got that these other people desire? What can
I do that other people can’t do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though he racked his brain he could find no answer
to the questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a while he rose and started to walk. He walked
fast, as if to escape from his own thoughts, and Fear,
so it seemed, walked by his side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing,” said Fear—“you have nothing to sell.
Nobody wants you—nobody will care if you starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go away,” said Wynne. “I tell you I am wanted.
I say I shan’t starve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little idiot! What have you learnt to do but sneer
at the real worker? There is no market price for sneers.
Sneerers starve—starve! Who are you to laugh at the
honest people of the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t laugh. I only pitied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How dared you pity—you, who have achieved nothing?
Even that small errand boy yonder is a worthier
citizen than you—he at least earns his ten francs a week.
What have you earned? Only the wage-slave deserves
to be a freeman. What is the value of all this trash of
art and æsthetics? These are only accessories of life—life
itself must be learnt before you can deal in these.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t want to be a wage-slave. I want to be
a king.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kingdoms are not won by desire. You must be a
subject first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will be a king—a ruler.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A beggar in a week. Come off the heights, little
idiot; come down into the plains and lay a road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne stopped suddenly in the great quadrangle of
the Louvre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right,” he said. “I’ll be content with small beginnings,
but show me the way to find them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And looking across the cobbled yard he saw three
people. They were quite ordinary, and obviously
English. There was a middle-aged man with a disposition
toward side-whiskers. He carried an umbrella, and
wore a severe bowler hat. His clothes spoke of prosperity
coupled with a due regard for quiet colours. By
his side walked a stout lady, in a tailor-made dress of
suburban cut. Upon her head reposed an example of
Paris millinery, and consciousness of its beauty gave her
face an added tendency to perspire. It was a new hat,
and did not seem to have sympathetic relations with her
boots. People who go abroad for the first time are apt
to overestimate the probable amount of wear their shoe-leather
is likely to incur, and guard against walking
barefoot by donning boots whose sturdiness would defeat
the depredations of a Matterhorn climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the lady’s side was a youth—a very unprepossessing
youth too. His face was blotchy, almost as blotchy
as his tie. His waistcoat was double-breasted and of a
violent grey. He carried a vulgar little cane in his
yellow-gloved hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the trio were strangers to the city was indisputably
betrayed by the consciousness of their manner
and the elaborate precautions they were at to look at
everything. The elder man drew attention to a sewer
grating in the middle of the quadrangle, and pointed
with his umbrella at the pigeons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they came to a halt, and produced a
Baedeker, which provided them with small enlightenment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are supposed to know French,” Wynne heard
the elder man say, “then why not ask some one how we
get into the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t,” replied the son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, all I can say is it seems a very funny thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While conversing they failed to observe the approach
of an official guide, who, complete with ingratiating
smile and a parchment of credentials, offered to pilot
them round the galleries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this they at once took flight, with much head-shaking
and confusion, and had the misfortune to run
into the arms of two more of the fraternity. These two
importuned them afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not,” said the paterfamilias, as though he
had been asked to participate in some very disgraceful
orgy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Englishman always runs away from a guide,
although sooner or later he becomes a victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being aware of this fact, one, more assiduous than
the rest, followed them closely with invitations and beseechings,
and headed them toward the spot where
Wynne was standing. It was clear that the unhappy
people were greatly unnerved, and equally clear that
in a moment they would cease to retreat, and surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perceiving this, Wynne was conceived of an idea, and
as they came abreast he brought to bear upon the guide
with a quick barrage of Paris invective. In effect his
words were: “These people are my friends—get out,”
although he coloured up the phrase with some generosity.
The victory was instantaneous, and a moment later he
had raised his hat and was saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you will be bothered any more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very kind of you—very kind,” said the father,
mopping his brow. “Great nuisance, these people.”
And the lady favoured Wynne with a grateful smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were about to visit the galleries?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, we thought we’d take a look round, you know.
The thing to do!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, quite. Are you familiar with the Louvre?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Er, no—no. Can’t say we are—no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m. I was wondering if I should offer to conduct
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hey? Well. Ho! I see! Not a bad idea! What
do you say, Ada?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be very nice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do this job, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Occasionally. Not regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I don’t mind. Got to see the things, I s’pose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is customary, isn’t it?” smiled Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hum. How long will it take to do the place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five years—perhaps a little less.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The joke was not well received, so Wynne modified
it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could show you the more vital points of interest
in a couple of hours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two hours, eh? And you’d want how much an
hour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne considered. “Should we say five francs?” he
suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly sight too much, I call it,” observed the blotchy
youth, whose name was Vincent. “Get a seat at a café
chantong for that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you say?” said the father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am silent, like the ‘G’ in <span class='it'>chantong</span>,” replied
Wynne. He had begun to feel the spice of adventure
in bartering, and would not give ground.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We mustn’t forget we are on a holiday,” the mother
reminded them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let it go,” said the father; “and I only hope it will
be worth it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can promise you it will be more than worth it,”
said Wynne, and led the way to the entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they mounted the stairs, blotchy Vincent plucked
at his sleeve and asked, <span class='it'>sotto voce</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say, do you know Paris well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Intimately. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only wondered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded toward his parents and shook his head
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was not entirely easy with his conscience at
having accepted the post of guide, and determined to
justify himself by a great liberality of artistic expression.
He therefore began to talk with exceeding rapidity
the moment they entered the first gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This collection is more or less mediocre, although
one or two examples are worthy of attention. This
Cupid and Psyche, for instance, may at first strike you
as insipid, but it presents interesting features. You
observe how there is a far greater similarity between the
sexes than we find in nature. It is almost as though,
by combining the two, the artist sought to arrive at the
ideal human form.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dare say he did,” admitted the father, rather uncomfortably,
while the mother looked with eyes that saw
nothing. Blotchy Vincent, on the other hand, pricked
up his ears at the word “sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One might sum up this school by saying they were
inspired by an hermaphroditic tendency.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M’yes. Well, I don’t think we need inquire into
that. It’s—hardly—er⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The same spirit is prevalent in modern French
sculpture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we will have a look at something else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s a nice picture,” said Mrs. Johns—for Johns
was the name of the family. “Very nice, I call that—quiet!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She directed their attention toward a large canvas
depicting a lady sitting upon a couch with her legs resting
straightly on its flat surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that <span class='it'>is</span> a nice picture,” agreed Mr. Johns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Vincent, however, lingered before Cupid and Psyche.
It did not compare with sundry picture postcards he had
seen, but it held greater attractions than the portrait of
Madame Récamier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I consider the colour is disappointing,” observed
Wynne—“disappointing and improbable. When one
comes to consider that Madame Récamier held in her day
the most popular Salon in Paris, and reflects that to do
so she must inevitably have been demimondaine of the
demimondaine, one is justified in expecting an added
brilliance to the cheeks and an added scarlet to the
lips.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hereupon Mr. Johns favoured Wynne with a warning
look, which he was pleased to ignore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This particular canvas is illustrative of what somebody—I
think Samuel Butler—said, that a portrait is
never so much of the sitter as of the artist. Shall we
take some of the older masters next?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way to an inner gallery, the Johns family
trooping behind him. As they passed through the
arched doorway Mr. and Mrs. Johns exchanged glances
as though to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we have made a great mistake introducing
this young man into our God-fearing midst!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before the canvases of the Old Masters Wynne expanded
his views with great liberality. Correggio and
Botticelli were favoured with a kindly mention, Rembrandt
was patted on the back, and Raphael severely
criticized. An ill-advised appreciation of a canvas by
Jordeans brought upon Mr. Johns a vigorous attack:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, believe me, very second-rate indeed. A mere
copyist of Rubens, who, himself, in no way justified the
position of being a target at which a self-respecting
artist should aim. Here is a Titian now⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really!” said Mrs. Johns. “I’ve often heard of
Titian red. Do you see, father, that’s a Titian.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes,” said Mr. Johns, consulting his catalogue.
“So it is. Seems good!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very wonderful how the colours last so long. Isn’t
it pretty, Vincent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Vincent, who was very bored.
“Dare say it’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” remarked Wynne, “if you can detect the
fault in that picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. and Mrs. Johns half closed their eyes, by which
means they fondly believed faults were more easily detected.
After much consideration they produced the
joint statement that it looked “a little funny—I don’t
know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fault lies in the fact that there are no faults—which,
to my way of thinking, is very heinous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That sounds nonsense to me,” said Mr. Johns, who
was getting heartily sick of the whole exposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. There must be impurity to emphasize
purity. Where would the Church be were it not for sinners?
What would be the worth of virtue if there were
no vice? Therefore I contend that nothing is so imperfect
as perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carried away by his own arguments, Wynne hurried
his charges along to Leonardo’s “Baptist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here he drew breath and started to speak afresh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An amazingly happy performance—instinct with
life, saturated with humour. You notice the same classic
tendency towards sexlessness? In my opinion this
is all a painting should be. There is something astonishingly
compelling in every line of the form and features.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is certainly very pleasant-looking,” said Mrs.
Johns. “Who was the young lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John the Baptist, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this Mr. Johns very properly interposed with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t tolerate jokes about the Bible, young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Vincent looked as though he expected Wynne
to be struck down by some divine and correcting hand.
Mrs. Johns was frankly horrified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look at your catalogue,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This advice Mr. Johns accepted, but even the printed
words failed to convince him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that’s John the Baptist,” he remarked, “all I
can say is that it’s not <span class='it'>my</span> idea of John the Baptist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is your idea, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An elderly gentleman with a beard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all respect, I think Leonardo’s is preferable.
Youth is more appealing than middle age. These half
humorous, wholly inspired features would lose the
greater measure of their attraction if the lower part of
the face were covered with hair.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree with you, and I don’t consider the
subject at all a proper one,” said Mr. Johns sternly.
“As for that picture, I am very sorry I’ve seen it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is probable Wynne would have answered hotly had
not Vincent advanced a suggestion:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you and the mater sit down for ten
minutes,” he said. “This Mr.—er—can take me round
for a bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to rest my feet,” admitted Mrs. Johns; “the
leather has begun to draw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Wynne and Vincent entered the next gallery together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My people are all right, you know,” said Vincent;
“but they are a bit off in Paris, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. <span class='it'>You</span> know! Isn’t there anything a bit more
lively we can see? I don’t think a lot of these Old
Masters—damned if I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne had to bear in mind that he was the servant
of these people, and accordingly he replied, civilly
enough:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you’d like the more modern school better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought French painting was a bit livelier, but
it seems about as dud as the Liverpool Art Gallery.
Aren’t there any more of those figure pictures?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nudes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That what you call ’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is what they are called.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s have a look at some, anyway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go through here, then, and I’ll show you
‘La Source.’ It is considered remarkable flesh painting,
although I don’t care for it very particularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they turned to the modern side, Vincent dropped
his voice, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty hot, Paris, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve never been here in the summer,” replied Wynne,
an answer which made his companion laugh very heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not giving much away, are you?” he
mocked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There,” said Wynne; “this is ‘La Source.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He halted before Ingres’ masterpiece—the slim figure
of a naked girl, a tilted pitcher on her shoulder, from
which flows a fall of greeny-white water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remarkable, perhaps, but not art.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Vincent, “I don’t like it either, you know.
I see what you mean—it isn’t spicy enough, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spicy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—you know. Look here, I was wanting a chance
to speak to you alone. I’ve got a bit of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are more fortunate than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind you having a bit of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mater and pater get to bed by 10 o’clock, and
I could easily slip out after that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ought not to be difficult.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We could meet, I thought, and you could show me
round a bit. See what I’m driving at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. What <span class='it'>are</span> you driving at?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see a bit of life, and you’re the chap to
show it me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly Wynne became very angry, so angry
that his face went pink and white in turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell do you mean?” he exploded. “Do
you take me for a disorderly house tout?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shut up—don’t shout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dirty, pimply— Good God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you call me names you won’t get your money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Money!” cried Wynne. “D’you think I’d take
money from any one who begat a thing like you. Clear
out, get away, and tell your father, when next he thinks
he’d like a son, to blow out his brains instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thrusting his hands in his empty pockets, and tossing
his head from side to side, Wynne stamped furiously
from the gallery and down the steps to the courtyard
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two hours before he recovered an even temper,
and then he surprised many passers-by by stopping in
the middle of the Rue de Rivoli and shouting with
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One up to my immortal soul,” he cried. “And now
for Les Arles!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>For well-nigh eighteen months Wynne Rendall,
seeker of eminence, destroyer of symmetry, professor
of æsthetic thought, worked with his hands in little byways
of the unfriendly city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had come to look on Paris as the unfriendly city,
for very shabbily she served him after his money gave
out. They laughed at his frail stature and careful,
elegant speech when he sought work in the Covent
Garden of the French capital, and it was a desperately
gaunt and hungry boy who at last found employment
in a small <span class='it'>pâtisserie</span> somewhere in the neighbourhood of
Boulevard Magenta. Things had gone so ill with him
that he was rocking on his heels, staring greedily at the
cakes in the pastry-cook’s window like any starving
urchin. He did not notice the printed card, “Youth
wanted,” which stood among the trays. A stout woman
behind the counter saw and beckoned him to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look hungry,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even short sentences were difficult.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you want work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to eat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eating is for people who work. Would you care for
a place here, delivering bread? I need some one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could not be trusted with a loaf,” he said, and
fainted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The stout lady was comparatively kind. She threw
water over his face, and when he came to, gave him
coffee, a piece of sausage, and some bread. She allowed
him to finish, and then told him very plainly he might
express gratitude by accepting the post of errand boy
at a small wage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Wynne it seemed that any wage was acceptable
which could be earned in an atmosphere so rich in
odours of cooked corn. He said “Yes” almost before
she had framed the offer. Later he repented, for the
hours of labour were incessant, the food scarce, and the
room in which he slept was dirty, damp, and ill-ventilated.
Of his weekly earnings, when he had bought
himself cigarettes and paid back a certain proportion
for lodging, there remained little or nothing. Books,
which had hitherto been the breath of life to him, were
of necessity denied. Very occasionally he scraped together
a few coppers and bought some dusty, broken-backed
volume which he scarcely ever found leisure
to read. He was too physically fatigued at night for
reading, and during the day was kept continually on the
run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not stay with the stout lady for long, but
the changes he made were rarely of great advantage.
Once he found employment at a small stationer’s, which
bade fair to prove pleasanter, but from here he fled
precipitately on account of the amorous importunities
of the stationer’s younger daughter. She, poor child,
had lost the affections of a certain artisan, who lodged
in the same house, and sought to regain them by exciting
jealousy. In the pursuance of this time-worn
device she proposed to sacrifice Wynne, and was prepared
to go to no mean lengths in order to give the
affair a colourable pretence of reality. Wherefore
Wynne ran, not so much from the probable fury of the
artisan as from a vague fear which he did not entirely
understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this episode he became a waiter—or, to be
exact, a wine boy. In this branch of employment he
was rather happier, although much of it proved irksome
and distasteful. He found that a waiter is allowed,
and even encouraged, to possess a personality. In the
other callings in which he had worked personality was
condemned, but customers welcome an individual note
in a waiter. It helps them to identify him among his
similarly arrayed companions, and affords them opportunity
for a lavish expenditure of wit and sarcasm not
always in the best taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time Wynne was able to save a little
money, which he put by towards paying the price of
a passage to England. He had decided to leave Paris
as soon as he had accumulated enough to pay the cost
of travel. In this matter, however, a certain inconsistency
forced him to remain. He would save the
best part of the two pounds required, and, a day or so
before departure, would yield to an irresistible impulse
and spend several francs on the purchase of a book. He
did this about a dozen times altogether, and although
the habit formed the nucleus of a library, it postponed
his departure indefinitely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he had in his possession the required sum,
and determined to leave Paris at the close of the week,
but certain pneumonic cocci floating in the atmosphere
and seeking a human abiding place, had other plans for
him, and by the Sunday morning, high-temperatured
and semi-conscious, he lay in his bed with a perilously
slender hold upon life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. le Patron had been aware of Wynne’s intention
to depart, and had been wishful of retaining his services.
Without Wynne it would be impossible for an honest
man to display in his window the legend “English
spoken,” an announcement which stimulated trade
among foreigners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly he put himself to the trouble of engaging
a doctor, whose injunctions in regard to the treatment
of the invalid he very faithfully followed. It
should be stated that he was no less faithful in recording
the out-of-pocket expenses incurred, which at the
close of a six weeks’ illness were presented to Wynne
in the manner of a debt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will now be necessary that you shall remain
until this sum is restored to me,” he said. “I am generous
not to have increased the liability, for times were
many when it seemed that I had incurred upon myself
the cost of a burial.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne reckoned that the least time in which he
could reasonably hope to clear the score would be from
three to four months, and raised his voice in protest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my career, monsieur—what will become of my
career?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Money is one of the few things a Frenchman takes
seriously; in nearly all other matters he is possessed
of an enchanting elasticity. Wynne’s lamentations
were heard without sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The debt must be discharged,” said M. le Patron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So once more Wynne donned his evening clothes with
the break of day, once more a serviette swung from the
bend of his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange to say menial service did not break his spirit
or lessen his conceit. There are certain compensations
in the life of a waiter if he be an observant fellow.
Many and various are the types in which he comes into
contact, and there is no surer way of fathoming the
character of man than is afforded by watching him at
his meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a certain extent Wynne took a pride in his waiting,
and made an especial study of the craft. It amused
him to “bank” his corners perilously with a pile of
plates on his hand; it amused him to whip off the cover
of an omelette and introduce it most exquisitely to its
future consumer; it amused him to theorise on a customer’s
likely choice of wine, and to suggest the vintage
as he handed the card. But most of all it amused him
to reflect that he, Wynne Rendall, was a waiter. Not
for an instant did it occur to him that, up to this
point, his achievements had not merited his occupation
of a more illustrious position. In the back of his head
was a comfortable assurance that he was a very important
and valuable person, and this being so, that it
was exceedingly droll for him to minister to the wants
of the vulgar-minded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He acquired the habit of jotting down his daily
thoughts on odd scraps of paper as he lay in bed at
night, and some of these would have made good reading
had they been preserved. Also they would have served
to show very clearly the streak of egoism which outcropped
his entire personality. Occasionally he flew to
verse of a style and metre very much his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here is an example:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Garçon!”</p>
<p class='line0'>In black and white I serve their bellies’ need,</p>
<p class='line0'>Paid with a frown, a curse, a penny in the franc.</p>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Will they thank</p>
<p class='line0'>Me with a smile, when, playing on my reed,</p>
<p class='line0'>I bid them hear, and from my cathedra</p>
<p class='line0'>Their silly loves and lusts, dull thoughts and empty creed,</p>
<p class='line0'>In black and white I show them as they are?</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The verse in itself has few merits, but it afforded him
a sense of luxury to produce such lines. He felt as a
king might feel who lay hidden in a hovel, conscious
of greatness in little places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To his brother waiters Wynne was ever remote and a
shade cynical. He laughed at, but never with them,
and affected a tolerant attitude which they found far
from endearing. Occasionally one of the sturdier would
attempt to bully him, but in this would seldom prosper.
A Frenchman, as a rule, bullies with his tongue rather
than his hands, and Wynne’s tongue was ever ready
with a lightning counterstroke. These passages were
in some respects a repetition of the old schoolday affairs,
and since he never forgot a lesson he was well armed to
defend himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the weeks dragged into months and the debt
gradually diminished.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One bright spring morning, some two years after
his arrival in Paris, Wynne received a surprise. A
broad-shouldered figure came under the shadow of the
awning and seated himself at one of the small round
tables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Uncle Clem!” gasped Wynne to himself. He
straightened his waistcoat and went outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M’sieur!” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Un bock,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unrecognized, Wynne retired and returned a moment
later with a glass tankard which he set upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beau temps, m’sieur!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, oui!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just such another day as the one we spent in Richmond
Park together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big Englishman turned his head and raised his
eyes sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Gad! It’s the Seeker!” he exclaimed. His
hand shot out, enveloped Wynne’s, and wrung it furiously.
“Sit down! What the devil are you up to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Waiting,” Wynne smiled; “but I haven’t given up
hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid—and this is fine”—he tweaked the apron.
“Serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man now, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something of the kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! though why the hell you couldn’t let us know
what had become of you⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Touch of pride, Uncle Clem. I neither wanted to
please my people nor disappoint you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, now, now, now! None of that—none of it.
They wouldn’t gloat and I might have helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne seated himself thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think that’s true; but I wonder if you believe
me when I say that never once has it crossed my mind
as a way out of the difficulty. When I left home I
left finally, not experimentally. If my father were to
see me as I am now he would say I had slipped down
hill, but I haven’t—I haven’t. Downhill I may have
gone with a bit of rush, but I’m gathering impetus
all the time, getting up weigh for the climb ahead.
You see that, don’t you? This is all to the good, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an honest, genuine sincerity in the way
he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Every time. All to the good. I should say it is.
Hullo! who the devil is this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This” was M. le Patron, highly incensed at the sight
of one of his waiters sitting at a table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ça fait rien,” began Uncle Clem. Then to Wynne,
“Oh, you tell him it’s all right; tell him I’m your
uncle—say you’re coming out for the afternoon. Here’s
ten francs. Get your hat, and shove that damned dicky
in your pocket. Tell the old fool he’s a good fellah and
to go to the devil.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain amount of foregoing advices were translated,
and M. le Patron, placated by the ten-franc note,
granted Wynne leave of absence and conversed affably
with Uncle Clem while Wynne mounted the stairs and
changed his coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on,” said Uncle Clem. “Let’s get somewhere
where we can talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hailed a fiacre and they drove to the Bois de Boulogne.
Here they alighted, and sprawled upon the grass
beneath a tree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now let’s have the story from the word Go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Wynne wound himself up and reeled off all his
experiences in the unfriendly city. Once or twice during
the recital Uncle Clem frowned, and once or twice
looked at his nephew in some perplexity, but in the main
he nodded encouragement or gave little ejaculations of
praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plucky enough,” he remarked at the close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder sometimes. Is it plucky merely to fight for
existence?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you merely fight for existence—was there no
impulse behind it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the impulse to do and to know has helped me
over the stonier parts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The painting was not a success, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t my medium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you found out what is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question was hard to answer. It would sound
futile to reply, “Writing,” when one had but a few
occasional jottings on the back of envelopes to substantiate
the claim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t had much time,” said Wynne, ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not. After all, the medium doesn’t matter—it’s
the motive that counts. Have you determined on
your motive?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have learnt enough to show people what they
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t. That’s a cynic’s task, not an artist’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes I think that one is but another name for
the other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not it. An artist shows people what they might
be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet many have climbed to the peaks” (he was too
self-conscious and diffident, with added years, to say the
Purple Patch) “by holding up a mirror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A mirror should only reflect beautiful folk,” he replied.
“There are better things than to be a man with
a camera.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sometimes wonder if there are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t wonder. Beauty is not to be found by sorting
out dustbins. Beauty is in the woods, Wynne.
Listen! You can hear the leaves in the tree above us
whispering of her, and the little waves in the pool yonder,
are leaping up lest they should miss her as she passes
by. Can’t you feel the wonder of her everywhere, now
in the spring, when she leaps splendid from her winter
hiding? D’y’know, when April’s here I throw open my
window and look up into the blue and then I see her
riding on a cloud. You know the kind of cloud—the
great white sort, which brings the summer from the
seas. Ha! Yes, and I shout my homage as I brush my
hair, and sometimes my poor man Parsons thinks I’m
cracked. But what’s the matter if she smiles—for she’s
a smiling lady if ever there was one, and her breath is
like a breeze which is filtered through a copse of violets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh Lord, you are just the same old Uncle Clem as
ever,” laughed Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn your eyes,” came the colloquial rejoinder—“if
you’re not patronizing me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. Believe me, I wouldn’t have you different,
but perhaps I’ve changed a bit, and these dream pictures
aren’t so real as they were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then make ’em real—they’re worth it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne hesitated, then said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m beginning to see the world as it is, and it
doesn’t look like that any longer. I see it as a vast
machine built up of cranks and gears, and bolts and cogs—some
odd, but mostly even. A thing of wheels and
reciprocal activity, for ever revolving and for ever returning
to the point from which it started. It’s hard to
believe in fairies when one thinks like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then don’t think like that, or, if you do, think of
the energy that moves the machine—that’s where the
mystery and the essence lie. The wheels are nothing—it
is the power which drives ’em that counts. Why,
heavens above! that should be the task for you, and
such as you—to find and refine the essence, to know and
increase the power. For God’s sake don’t scorn a thing
because it goes round, but give it a push that it may
revolve faster. That’s the job! and a fine job too. It’s
easy to acquire cheap fame by jeering at a man because
he goes to bed at night and gets up in the morning—easy—but
no good. Give him something to get up
early for and sleep the better for; that’s the way to earn
your own repose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you were the man who first showed me a satyr,”
said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I was the man who told you of the Purple
Patch,” came the reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, and I shall get there in the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not by being of the clever ones. They sit on
the lower slopes. They bark—they don’t sing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Up against intellect now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m against obvious intellect all the time, because
it’s perishable. Look here, I may not make myself clear,
but of this I am sure—a great man is not great because
he is clever, but he is clever because he is great. The
cleverness of the clever is merely an irritant. For a
season it may tickle the public palate, but it will never
endure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how does a man become great?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the strength of his ideals. Ideals never perish
because they are never wholly realized—besides, they
spring from other causes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is the fountain of ideals?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Feeling—human feeling. Don’t you know that—yet?”
He turned a penetrating glance on his nephew.
“Never been in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne coloured slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied, “I’ve never been in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then be in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s rather—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No it ain’t. You must be in love—it’s God’s great
education to mankind. A man knows nothing of himself,
or of anything else, unless he is a lover. Happy—wretched—sacred
or profane—love is the mighty teacher.
What the devil d’you mean by never having been in
love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne laughed. “Couldn’t I ask the same question
of you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you couldn’t, for I always am. Ah, I may not
be married—and that is a great blessing for some poor
dear unknown—but I’m always in love. Sometimes it’s
a girl with whom I have never exchanged a word, sometimes
a dead queen or a goddess of ancient times, and
sometimes in silly, sordid ways which lonely men will
follow. But the spark of love that is, or the spark of
a love that was, I keep for ever burning. What sort of
life do you imagine mine would be without it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there a difference,” said Wynne. “You’re
not a striver—you are content⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’m a loafer—a dilettante—who whistles his
song of praise in the country lanes—but⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country lanes are the lover’s lanes; there is
no time for love in the great highways. How does the
line go? ‘He travels fastest who travels alone.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem rose and, stretching out a hand, pulled
Wynne to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may travel fast,” he said, “but he don’t get so
far. Come on! What do you think—lunch chez
Fouquet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They made a very excellent déjeuner at the pleasant
little restaurant under the shadow of the Arc de
Triomphe, and when it was over, and Uncle Clem had
produced two delicate Havana cheroots, the conversation
turned to Wynne’s future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve done enough of this waiting business,” he
said. “Better come back with me at the end of the
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” said Wynne, “but it won’t run to it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m your uncle—so that’s that, ain’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s that as far as the relationship goes, but no
farther.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you mean you won’t be helped?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but it doesn’t mean I’m not grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But look here—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t make me,” pleaded Wynne. “It would be so
easy that way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s all nonsense. You’ve proved your mettle—no
harm relaxing a trifle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have proved my mettle to the extent of being a
waiter,” said Wynne, “and that isn’t as far as I want
my mettle to carry me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might be here for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. It will be my fault if I am. I have to
prove my right to climb. Help would disprove it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Pon my soul I admire your pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all you do admire, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, get away with you! I talk a lot, that’s all;
but I’ve a mighty strong conviction that you’ll do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll do <span class='it'>and</span> do,” said Wynne. “Maybe you won’t
approve, but I hope you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope so, and believe so—for the elements are yours—but
I shan’t tell you so if I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With which somewhat cryptic remark they parted.
Wynne had not gone very far down the street, however,
before he was overtaken by a somewhat breathless
Uncle Clem, who said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, for God’s sake, fall in love if you can.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span><h1>PART FOUR<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE PEN AND THE BOARDS</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The manner of Wynne’s return to England was
fortuitous. It resulted from the remark of a
chance customer at the little restaurant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish to heaven you’d come right down to one of
my rehearsals, young man, and show the Gordam idiot
I’ve engaged how a waiter waits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speaker was a Cockney impresario who had come
to Paris to collect a few French revue artistes for a scene
in a London production.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come and play the part if you like,” replied
Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The little man scrutinized him closely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some idea!” he ejaculated (he had a habit of employing
American expressions). “But could you realize
your own personality?—that’s the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God! you don’t imagine this is my personality,”
came the reply. “This is as much a performance
as any of Sarah Bernhardt’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Durn me, but I believe you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result Wynne took the evening off without permission,
and made his first acquaintance with the histrionic
art. Being in no way affected with nervousness
he did not attempt to do otherwise than portray a waiter
as a waiter actually is. The producer acclaimed the performance
with delight. He sacked the other probationer,
and gave Wynne a contract for two months at a
salary of two pounds five shillings a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I am to come with you I shall want five pounds
down to discharge a debt,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The impresario grumbled somewhat, but since he was
paying thirty shillings a week less than he had anticipated,
and was getting a vastly superior article, he finally
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So Wynne signed the contract, pocketed the notes, and
went to break the news to his employer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>M. le Patron was not stinting in the matter of abuse.
He condemned Wynne very heartily for lack of devotion
to his welfare, upbraided himself for misplaced
generosity, offered him an increased wage to remain,
and finally—protest proving useless—shook hands and
wished him every kind of good fortune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four days later found the little company of players
waiting for the outgoing train at the Gare du Nord.
To Wynne there was something tremendously portentous
in the moment. To find seclusion for his thoughts he
walked to the extreme end of the platform, where it
sloped down to the line, and here, to the unlistening
ears of a great hanging water-pipe, he bade farewell to
the Unfriendly City.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of these days I shall return,” he spoke aloud;
“one of these days you will stretch out your hands to
welcome me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the little Cockney impresario who had followed
him, fearful lest he should try to escape with the five
pounds, touched his shoulder, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Studying your part, son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Always,” came the answer.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>They arrived in London about half-past six the
same evening, and Wynne could not help smiling as he
noticed how all the good people were hurrying homeward
from their work as though their lives depended upon
expedition. As he came from the station he observed
how they fought for places on the omnibuses, and jostled
down the steps to the tube stations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Paris one is never conscious of that soundless siren
which bids mankind close the ledger and lock the office
door. The Parisian does not appear to be in any immediate
hurry when work is over. He stays awhile to
converse with a friend, or takes his <span class='it'>petit verre</span> under the
shade of a café awning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne reflected that the English must be a very
virtuous race to exert so much energy to arrive home.
He recognized that the old goddess of punctuality was
still at work, and that the popular craving to be at a
certain place at a certain time, which had galled him
so much as a boy, was no false imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are still in a hurry—still tugged along by their
watch-springs,” he thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he watched the tide of hastening humanity he became
suddenly aware that he was glad that it should
be so—glad for a personal reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Routine which formed so national a characteristic
argued a nation whose opinions, once formed, would
endure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To be accepted by such a people would mean to inherit
an imperishable greatness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Presently,” he thought, “these people will accept
me as essential to their lives. I shall be as necessary
to them as the 8.40 from Sydenham. They will no more
miss me than they would miss their breakfasts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this point the little impresario once more broke in
upon his reflections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten o’clock rehearsal tomorrow,” he said. Then
with severity, slightly diluted with humour, “No slipping
off, mind. Feel I ought to keep an eye on you till that
debt’s wiped off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is hard for any one to maintain glorious views as to
the future while the present holds a doubt as to his
probity in the matter of a five-pound note.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the second time in his life Wynne occupied the
bedroom in the little Villers Street hotel. The good
lady proprietress said she really did not remember if
he had stayed there before or not, but she “dared say”
he had. It was the sight of apparently the same uncooked
sirloin surrounded by apparently the same tomatoes
which had lured Wynne back to the little eating-house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner he conversed with the waiter upon technical
subjects, and gave his views upon perfection in the art
of waiting. The worthy fellow to whom these were addressed
was not greatly interested however. He was
glad to converse with any one skilled in his native tongue,
but a long sojourn in the British Isles had given him
taste for a meatier conversational diet, and he preferred
the remarks of two men at another table who exchanged
views relative to Aston Villa’s chances in the Cup
Tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In consequence Wynne was left to his own thoughts,
which, on this particular night, he found both pleasant
and companionable. It was good to feel that at last
he would be earning a livelihood by means of an Art,
and a good Art too. Not so good, perhaps, but that it
might not be a great deal better. In the few rehearsals
he had already attended he had noted some glaring
conventions and very grave stupidities, which he
vowed in the future he would eradicate. The position of
producer—a calling of which hitherto he had hardly
been aware—suggested, of a sudden, illimitable possibilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The producer was the man with the palette and
brushes, and the artistes were merely tubes of colour, to
be applied how and where they would give the best result.
There was no end to what a producer might achieve,
and perhaps no better medium for conveying ideas to
the public mind than through the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And just as Wynne had said, nearly two years before,
“I must learn this trade of painting,” he now determined
to master the art of acting in all its variations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must write, too,” he thought, “and read and
work all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed a hand across his forehead and exhaled
noisily. Great are the responsibilities which a man will
take upon his shoulders!</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the outset of his career as an actor Wynne found
much to disappoint him. He learnt that brains and
application do not necessarily result in stage success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among all the actors he met it was all too often the
case that the most intelligent were the least successful.
Personality and notoriety outweighed intellect. Even
the most egregious ass, provided he was representative
of a certain type, prospered exceedingly, while the really
clever ones languished in the understudy room or formed
unspeaking props to hang clothes upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man needs to be on the stage some while before
he can appreciate that casting and the box office are
the chief considerations in a producer’s mind. It is
easier and more satisfactory to engage a fool to play a
fool than to ask a wise man to turn his wisdom to folly.
Also it is a shrewd business stroke to give the public
some very rapturous feminine vision to behold rather
than give the part to some lady whose brain has a greater
claim to admiration than her features. The world forgives
stupidity when offset by loveliness—or even by a
hint of subtle scandal—but a very high standard of intellectual
perfection is required before the world will
ignore a youth which has passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking these matters into consideration, Wynne was
constrained to believe that if theatre-goers were blind,
and men gave up talking of matters which concerned
them not, there would be an immediate demand for a
class of actors, and particularly actresses, of a far higher
mental quality than heretofore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regarding acting as an Art he had more admiration
for the surviving members of the old school, who handed
over their lines with an assumption of great importance,
than he entertained for the scions of the new.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You, at least, do something,” he observed to one old
fellow, in a drama company of which he had become a
member. “You do something, and do it deliberately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s so, my boy—that’s so,” came the mightily
satisfied endorsement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These moderns do nothing but realize their own ineffability.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true—it’s too true!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And of course the worst of it is what you do is
utterly useless—utterly false—and utterly wrong⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?” A stick of grease-paint fell to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whereas what they fail to do is, in the general sense,
absolutely right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Remarks of this kind do not make for popularity.
This, however, did not concern Wynne in the least.
He had acquired the habit of talking rather less than
he was used to do. The thoughts and convictions which
at one time had bubbled to the surface he now mentally
noted and preserved. He felt, in the pride of his
egoism, that it was not wise to give away his ideas in
conversation to the more or less trivial people with whom
he came into touch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was otherwise when one of the more successful
members of the company deigned to exchange a few remarks,
for then he would bring all his mental batteries
to work with a view to prove to them how vastly inferior
they actually were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One or two engagements were lost through the exercise
of this habit, and several straitened and penniless
periods resulted. Twice in three years Wynne left the
stage, but from circumstance or inclination gravitated
back again. He was always able to earn two pounds
to two pounds ten a week playing small character parts,
and if his attitude had been a shade more congenial it
is probable he would have done still better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a character actor he was singularly faultless and
singularly conscientious. He possessed a remarkable
facility for submerging his own personality and throwing
off tiny portraits of different types, which were
recognizable to the minutest detail. In the performance
of these he took special pride, but if the producer
interfered or made any suggestions he was truculent to
a degree, and fought for his rendering with tiresome
constancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t as if your suggestion would be in the least
improving, and—good God!—if I am not to be trusted
alone with eight lines, why on earth engage me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remark was fired at a super-eminent producer
before an entire West End company, and brought back
from the black void of the auditorium:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you please draw a fortnight’s salary from the
business manager, Mr. Rendall, and return your contract?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the theatre straight away, and did not attempt
to draw the salary. In the sunshine outside he was overtaken
with a masterful desire to cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They shan’t lead me—they shan’t! they shan’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the wail of a little boy rather than of a man
who fain would be a king.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He returned to his room in Endell Street and flung
himself face downward on the bed, where he lay with
heaving shoulders for a long, long while. Presently
he turned round and sat bolt upright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody is against me, and I’m against everybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the table before him was a heap of books and
a pile of papers, odd jottings, queer little articles, scraps
of poetry written in the after-theatre hours. With a
sudden fury he kicked at the table-leg and sent them
tumbling and fluttering to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do I hate the world when I want to exalt it?
Oh, God—God—God! Damn this room! Oh, I’m
lonely, I am so—so horribly lonely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went and stood in the corner, rested his head on
the faded wallpaper, and sniffed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m lonely—lonely—lonely—lonely—lonely! I
don’t think I’m very strong—I think I’m ill—ill and
lonely—lonely and ill—very ill, and very lonely!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then suddenly he burst out laughing:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool!—idiot!—I’m all right! Papers all over the
place. Pick ’em up. What’s all this rot about?” He
read a few lines in his own handwriting: “A good sort
is the type of man with whom we trust our sisters—a
bad sort is the type of man with whom our sisters
trust themselves!’ Epigram! Too long! ‘A sport is
a man who says Cherio, and carries his brains in a
cigarette case.’ Necktie would be better. Oh! what’s
the good of writing this rubbish? What am I going
to do now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snatched a hat and went out. Presently he found
himself in Pen and Ink Square, with the ceaseless
grumble of the news-producing engines throbbing in
the air. Before him was a doorway over which was
written “<span class='it'>The Oracle</span>.” He knew “<span class='it'>The Oracle</span>” for a
democratic organ which shrieked obscenely at the politics
and morals of the country—under the guise of seeking
to purify, it contrived to include in its columns some
very prurient matter, without which its sales would
have been even smaller than they were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne walked straight in, mounted some stairs, and
beholding a door labelled “Editor—Private,” entered
without knocking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who the devil are you?” said a stout man sitting before
a roll-top desk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t know if I told you,” replied Wynne.
“I’m nobody yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought I’d write some articles for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think again—outside!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might not get in so easily another time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, get out now, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s very foolish. How d’you know I may not
be bringing you a fortune?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m prepared to take the risk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then take a smaller one, and give me a subject to
write you a sample about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Write about damn nuisances,” said the editor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me a sheet of paper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here! Are you going to get out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You told me to write about damn nuisances,
and I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the editor leant back in his chair and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if you haven’t a profound cheek—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Realizing the opening, Wynne seated himself before
a vacant table and took up a pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paper and silence,” he said, “are the ingredients
required, and you shall have your article in an hour’s
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being a man of some humour the editor relaxed,
and laughed exuberantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go to it then,” he said. “I’m off to tea, and I
shall clear you out when I come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll do nothing of the kind. I’ll be on the permanent
staff by nightfall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In writing upon damn nuisances Wynne took for
his subject such widely divergent national symbols as
the Albert Memorial and <span class='it'>The Oracle</span>. Of the two
<span class='it'>The Oracle</span> fared worst, and came in for the most
complete defamation in its heartily criticized career.
The article was iconoclastic, spirited and intensely
funny. The entire office staff read it, and the editor volunteered
to take Wynne out and make him drunk then
and there. This offer Wynne declined, but he accepted
the post of a casual article writer at a penny a line, and
returned home with a greater feeling of satisfaction than
he had known for some time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The satisfaction, however, was short-lived, for in a
very little while he was heartily ashamed of subscribing
his signature to scurrilous paragraphs deprecating the
private lives of parsons, and hinting darkly at dirty
doings in Downing Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He perceived that by such means greatness was not
to be achieved, and sought to ease his conscience by
spending nearly all his earnings on reputable books,
and most of his spare time in the reading-room at the
British Museum. In the matter of food he was most
provident, scarcely, if ever, standing himself a good
meal. He acquired the habit of munching chocolate and
of making tea at all hours of the day and night. By
this means, although he staved off actual hunger, he
was never properly satisfied, and his physical side became
ill-nourished and gaunt. The hours he kept were
as irregular as could well be conceived, and he frequently
worked all night without a thought of going to bed.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The days of his employment on the staff of <span class='it'>The
Oracle</span> were far from happy, and the material he was
asked to write soured his style and embittered his outlook.
Of this circumstance he was painfully aware, and
tried to combat it by writing of simple, gentle matters
for his own education. But the canker of cynicism
overran and corrupted his better thoughts like deadly
nightshade twining in the brambles of a hedgerow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always his own severest critic, he would tear up the
sheets of close-written manuscript and scatter them over
the room, stamp his feet or throw up the window and
hurl imprecation at the dying night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes he sent articles or stories to the press,
but from them he received no encouragement. <span class='it'>The
Oracle</span> had an unsavoury reputation in Fleet Street,
and no self-respecting editor desired to employ the
journalists who wrote for this vicious little rag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After his uncompromising attitude at their first meeting,
the editor of <span class='it'>The Oracle</span> made a great deal of
Wynne, and besought him to sign a binding contract.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t sign anything,” Wynne replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll give you a salary of seven pounds a week if you
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t for seventy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll think better of it later on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Later on I shall wish to God I had never written
for you at all. It isn’t a thing to be proud of.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this the editor laughed and clapped him on the
back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wanting some one like you for years,” he
cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll be wanting some one like me again before
long,” came the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange to say, the stout man did not resent Wynne’s
attitude, neither did he understand it. He regarded
this queer, emaciated boy as an agreeable oddity, and
allowed him to say whatever he liked. Wynne was most
valuable to <span class='it'>The Oracle</span>, for his articles were infinitely
more educated and infinitely more stinging than any of
the other writers’. As a direct result they caused a corresponding
increase of irritation and a corresponding
improvement in sales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever there was a hint of scandal, or any disreputable
suggestion in regard to some notable personage,
Wynne was put on the track, with <span class='it'>carte noire</span> to
give the affair the greatest possible publicity. In the
pursuance of this degrading journalese of detection and
exposure he disclosed unexpected moral considerations.
When he did not consider the person to be attacked
merited rough handling he would resolutely decline to
associate himself in any way with the campaign. Entreaties
and protests were alike incapable of moving him.
He would set his mouth, and refuse, and fly into a
towering fury with the editor when he suggested:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then, Harbutt must do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t there enough beastliness in the world without
seeking it where it doesn’t exist?” cried Wynne.
“I’ll burn this damn building to the ground one of these
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not actually put this threat into practice,
but did the next best thing. A dispute had arisen in
regard to some sordid disclosures which the editor desired
to make, and Wynne had proved beyond dispute
that there was no foundation for the charges. The
editor, however, decided that the story was too good
to lose, and accordingly had it inserted, with a thin
veil drawn over the identity of the persons concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said Wynne, after he had seen a copy.
“You’re going through the hoops for this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An opportunity arose a short while after, and Wynne
seized it without scruple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the habit of the paper to reserve a column each
month in which to set forth their ideals and intentions.
Sometimes one and sometimes another of the
writers undertook this work. As a rule it was the last
paragraph to be inserted, and depended for its length
upon the available space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sub-editor, who was also proof-reader, was not a
conscientious man, and frequently delegated his duties
to subordinates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all plain sailing,” he said to Wynne. “Write
about four hundred words, and sling it over to the compositor.
I’m meeting a friend or two tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that he went out, and Wynne, with a peculiar
smile, wrote the article, and very faithfully described
the motives which inspired the paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>The Oracle</span>,” he wrote, “is the Mungo of the London
Press—a sniffing wretch for ever scrabbling garbage in
the national refuse heaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a good deal more in this style, and the
compositor, while setting up the type, was not a little
disturbed in mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is this to be printed?” he asked Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Danged if I can see what the idea is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Imagine the sales, and go ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entire issue had to be destroyed, but one or two
copies escaped from the printer’s hands, and a rival
flew to hilarious headlines about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the amazement of every one Wynne marched into
the office the morning after he had perpetrated the offence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the hell is the idea?” shouted the editor.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Getting even with my conscience,” replied Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked very frail and insignificant with the semi-circle
of scarlet, inflamed countenances and threatening
fists besetting him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you don’t want to be killed, take your blasted
conscience out of here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did, but with no great speed, although many were
the offers of violence made as he passed out.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the Embankment Wynne apologized to God very
sincerely for having debased his art. It was rather a
pretty little prayer which he put up, and had a gentler
tenor than his wonted expression. After it was finished
he felt easier in mind, and comforted. But when he
returned to his rooms the oppression of a great loneliness
took command of his soul. Of late this feeling
had dominated his thoughts not a little. He desired
some one to whom he might confess his thoughts and
fears, some one of the sympathetic intellect, who could
smooth out the harsher creases of life’s cloak, and give
companionable warmth to the solitary hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No such friendships had come his way, and when
he turned his thoughts more closely to the subject he
could not imagine that he would be likely to happen
upon such a one. Beyond the intermittent flashes of
Uncle Clem’s society there had been no one with whom
he could discuss his real feelings and emotions. Pride,
and desire to excel, had kept him from seeking Uncle
Clem when the mood of loneliness was upon him. He,
as it were, saved up that friendship for the great days
ahead. The few occasions when he had sought to
quicken intimacy from acquaintance had invariably led
to nothing. Once a young actor asked him to share an
idle hour or two, and before they arrived at the end
of the street stopped at the door of a public-house and
invited him to enter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s get primed—what do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Wynne said, “Need we? I don’t drink for a
hobby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Care for a game of pills?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what <span class='it'>do</span> you care about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion that in order to be entertained one
must either drink or play billiards made Wynne laugh,
and since no man cares to have his more serious pleasures
ridiculed, the young actor snorted, and left him to spend
the rest of the evening alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possibly it was loneliness which directed Wynne once
more to seek employment upon the stage. In the play
in which he appeared he was given the part of a hot-potato
man who was on the stage for only a few moments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To perfect the detail for this rôle he made the acquaintance
of a real example of this calling, and spent
many midnight hours talking with the old fellow and
warming himself before the pleasant coke fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne discovered that there was a deal of philosophy
to be gleaned in this manner. Thereafter he became well
known to many of the strange, quiet men who feed the
hungry in queer, out-of-the-way corners of the sleeping
city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sundays he would go to Petticoat Lane, or pry
into the private lives of the outcasts of Norfolk House.
The East End fascinated him, with its mixture of old
customs and new—its spice of adventure and savour of
Orientalism. Many of the folk with whom he conversed
were strangely illuminating. After an initial period
of distrust and suspicion they would open out and disgorge
some startling views on life and matters in general.
They spoke of anarchy and crime and confinements
as their more civilized brothers of the West spoke
of the brand of cigarettes they preferred. The elemental
side of these men’s natures, being so totally dissimilar
from his own, made a profound impression upon Wynne.
Their attitude toward women amazed and perplexed
him. The phrase, “<span class='it'>my</span> woman,” with its solid, possessive,
animal note, was original to the ears. It suggested
an entirely different attitude from the one he had observed
in France, the one so alive with thrill and volatile
desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> woman!” he repeated it over to himself as he
plodded homeward through the dark streets. He said
it experimentally with the same inflection that had been
used—and yet to him it was only an inflection. He
could not conceive a circumstance in which he would
naturally stress the “my,” or would actually feel the
possessive impulse to make it inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s <span class='it'>my</span> woman,” the man had said, when telling
his story—“<span class='it'>my</span> woman, d’y’hear?” Followed an oathy
description of a chair and table fight, a beer bottle
broken across a bedrail and used as a dagger—something,
that was once a man, carried in the arms of a
trustworthy few and hidden in a murky doorway a
couple of streets distant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to imagine such a coming about at the
dictates of a convention of sex. If a woman inclined
to sin with another man, let her—what did it matter?
Fidelity was of very little consequence. Common reason
proved it to be a myth. Yet men committed murder
that fidelity—physical fidelity—might be preserved.
That’s what it amounted to. But did it? That possessive
“my” argued a greater and more masterful motive—something
beyond mere moral adherences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> woman!” Very perplexing!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I suppose I would fight to the death for my
ideals—whatever they may be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With sudden force it struck Wynne that he should
define his ideals, and know precisely at what he aimed.
It was good for a man to be certain of those things for
which he would be prepared to lay down his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He set himself the task of writing down what his
ideals actually were, and in so doing failed horribly.
What he wrote was inconclusive and embryonic. To a
reader it would have conveyed little or nothing. There
was a hint of some ambition, but nothing more. It
showed the target of his hopes in the pupal stage. The
grammatical perfection with which he wrote only added
melancholy to the failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” exclaimed Wynne, “I can’t even write
a specification of what I want to do.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The play in which Wynne figured as a hot-potato
man was not a success, and there followed a period in
which he found no work, and very considerable hardship.
Then his fortunes turned a trifle, and to reward
himself for all he had endured he took new rooms at
the top of a house near Tottenham Court Road, and
spent all his money buying furniture and queer odds
and ends of brass and Oriental china. It was the first
time he had indulged in the luxury of agreeable appointments,
and it gave him tremendous pleasure. The
furniture he bought was true to its period, though time
and the worm had bitten deep beneath the blackened
surfaces. He bought in the Caledonian Market or little
known streets, and took a fierce pride in bartering for
his prizes. These he would bring home upon his head,
or, if their size defeated his powers, would push them
before him on a greengrocer’s barrow. For pieces of
<span class='it'>vertu</span> he possessed a sure and infallible eye, and a remarkable
sense for disposing them to the best advantage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the mantelpiece of the attic sitting-room he
achieved successfully what, years before, he had failed
to do in his father’s home. A note of colour from a
cracked Kin Lung bowl, a fillip of light from a battered
copper kettle, a slanting pile of beautifully-bound books,
and the thing was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no struggle after effect, but the effect was
there as if by nature—the right things had found their
rightful abiding place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found writing easier in these surroundings.
Hitherto his eye had inevitably fallen upon some
hideous object or picture, unthinkingly bought and
disastrously disposed in relation to its neighbours—then
his thoughts would travel away, lose the thread of their
reasoning, or become involved in futile speculation upon
other folks’ perverted tastes. But here it was different:
here there were no disturbing influences, nothing but a
pleasant, restful simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Mommet, the bed-shaker, who, for a very small
wage, gave Wynne an equally small measure of time,
did not share his high opinions of himself as a
decorator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know ’ow you can put up with the place,”
she said, shaking her head sadly over the pail of dirty
water which was her constant companion. “It gives
me the creeps every time I comes into it. That ole
table, y’know. Well, it <span class='it'>looks</span> as if it was a ’undred
years old.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a great deal more,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you are, y’see! Why you don’t git a nice
cloth and cover it up beats me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Roundheads drank at that table,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fat-’eads, more like—nowhere for your knees or
anything. And the walls, too! My ole man does a
bit o’ paper-’anging to oblige in ’is spare time. I dessay
’e’d ’ang a piece for you, to oblige.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would oblige me very much by doing nothing of
the kind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thet’s silly—that is. No one can’t like plain walls
when they can ’ave ’em floral. Not so much as a picture
anywhere! W’y don’t you pin up a few photos?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t possess any, and I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if that’s all, I dessay I could give you a few.
Liknesses, they’d be—not views. You could ’ave any
one of my pore Minnie o’o was took.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne did not want to offend the woman, but was
forced to safeguard his own peace of mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You ought not to give them away in the circumstances,”
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately Mrs. Mommet did not press the offer.
She had some views to express in relation to “nice plush
curtains,” which Wynne hastily discouraged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, you must please yourself, I s’pose.
Gentlemen never do ’ave any taste, as the sayin’ is.
Still, it’s no small wonder you look poorly, and yer face
is as white as the under-side of a lemon sole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The description was apt. Wynne’s features were certainly
of a lifeless hue. The long hours, the poor food,
and the never-ending mental activity had sapped a full
measure of his youth. No one would have placed his
age at twenty-three, yet twenty-three summers were all
that he held to his credit. One might have guessed him
nearer forty—and a none too hearty forty either. Only
his eyes were young—young and greedily active—for
ever assessing and assimilating, but this seemed to detract
from, rather than add to, his youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet despite his frailty and general suggestion of
weakness, Wynne could, upon occasion, develop startling
energy. He used his brain as the driving force which
overcame his feebleness, and bade his muscles undertake
tasks out of all proportion to their ability. On one occasion
he carried an armchair, weighing nearly a hundredweight,
for three miles, a task which a strong man
might well have failed to accomplish. His power lay
in the will to do, and a form of obstinate courage which
defied all obstacles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you said soul,” he said, “for I have long
believed that to be the only thing that matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Mommet shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was talkin’ of fishmonger’s, not parson’s souls,”
she replied; “but if you ask me, I should say firce look
after the body, and the soul’ll look after itself. Same
as the ole sayin’ ’bout the pennies and the poun’s. If
you was to feed your body up a bit, ’stead o’ wastin’
money on ole cracked plates, books and whatnot, you’d
be doing yerself more good, you would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depends on the point of view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know I can’t never do nothin’ if I neglect my bit
o’ nourishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I, but you work with your body and I with my
brain. That’s why we stock our larders with different
fare. There’s mine yonder.” He tilted his head
toward the crowded bookcases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lot o’ nonsense! Ole books!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t despise them, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t; but a book’s a thing for after dinner, not
to make yer dinner off of, like you do. Wonder is you
’aven’t more pride in yerself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pride?” He was quite startled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young feller like wot you are lettin’ ’imself go to
pieces like the lilies in the field, or whatever the sayin’
is. ’Ow d’you s’pose you’ll ever take the fancy of a
young woman lookin’ like you do? You wouldn’t never
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne smiled. “Is it only the dressed ox which can
go to the altar?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I donno nothin’ ’bout dressed oxes, but I do know
as any young woman of spirit looks for a man with a
bit of blood in ’im. After all, nature’s nature, y’know,
with Christian or ’eathen alike, and there’s no gettin’
away from it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should write a treatise on Eugenics,” said
Wynne, and escaped to the solitude of his bedroom.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>During a rehearsal of a new play in which he
was engaged Wynne noticed Eve Dalry. She
was walking-on in the crowd, and did not seem
of a piece with the other girls. When her scene was
over she slipped away to a quiet corner and produced
a book. Finding the required page, she shook her head
as though to banish other considerations, seated herself
on an upturned box, and began to read with great
absorption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Partly from curiosity to see the title of the book
Wynne moved toward her. Carlyle’s “Heroes and Hero
Worship.” A queer choice for a girl to make, he
thought, and wondered how much she understood. For
awhile he stood behind her glancing at a paragraph here
and there, and watching the careful way she turned
over a page, then turned it back again to reread and
reconsider some passage not wholly understood. He was
unused to women who read so seriously, and, despite the
semi-cynical smile at the corners of his mouth, her
studiousness impressed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, impelled by a new and curious familiarity,
he drew a long, tapered forefinger over the straight,
thin parting in her hair. She looked up slowly, as
though his action had been scarcely enough to distract
her attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like the shape of your head,” he found himself
saying in reply to the query in her eyes, “it is the
kind of vessel which is never empty. The square of
your chin, too, is so very right. One seldom sees the
two together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She met the critical survey with equal candour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been liking your head,” she said, “but not
the chin. Its⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a slanting line in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” he nodded; “but it’s not significant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I meant that—insignificant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was not at his best when humour turned
against him. His smile and his frown struck a balance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could quote the names of a dozen brilliant men
who did not carry their strength or wit in the lower
half of their faces, and illustrate my instances at the
National Portrait Gallery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you brilliant?” There was no barb to the
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It pleases me to think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One wonders, then, why you are doing this little
jobbery in a theatre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s reasonable enough. I wonder, too, sometimes.
I suppose I was hungry when I took the engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is not your real work, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly know what my real work is, but it is not
in the market. In theory real work never should be in
the market.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>quoted Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spare me from Kipling. It is so disheartening to
find one’s views supported by quotations.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so advanced as that. I’m rather proud of
quotations—I look on them as medals for reading.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made an intolerant gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But no sane persons show their medals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I’m young I had rather not be altogether
sane.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! I take back sanity. It’s the worst asset an
artist can possess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with a faint, intricate smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are easy to catch out,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Possibly. I don’t aspire to be a cricketer. Indeed,
cricket stands for all I dislike most. Cricket is an
Englishman’s notion of the proper conduct of life—a
game with rules. If he resists seducing a friend’s wife
it is because to do so is not cricket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you favour his doing so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I—but it depends on the mood and the man,
and the attraction. I simply do not admit the existence
of cricket in these matters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” said Eve, “you seem to me to be
expressing ideas and not thoughts. Tell me, what is
your real work?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I assume that one day I shall know, but I don’t
know yet. If I were to say painting—writing—talking—acting—I
should be equally right. I have searched
the dictionaries in vain to find a word to describe myself.
The verb ‘to lead’ is the nearest approach. I
think, by nature, I am the centre of a circle—a circle
that is even widening. Sounds absurd, doesn’t it?—to
lead from the centre of a circle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conviction and frankness with which he discussed
himself was remarkable, and, strangely enough, not offensive.
He possessed a quality of magnetism which
robbed his words of half their arrogance. Eve allowed
her eyes to travel over him with calm interest. His
clothes were careless and shabby, his collar too big, and
his cuffs frayed; his tie seemed anywhere but in the
right place. At the first glance she saw he was ill-nourished,
and felt an immediate impulse to feed him
up with possets and strong beef tea. Frailty excites
kindly resolves from the generous-hearted. She found
his features attractive, despite their irregularity, and his
eyes appealed to her enormously. They were such
plucky eyes, eyes that would look the world in the face
unfalteringly and support with impertinent courage the
wildest views which the mobile, cynical, and weak mouth
might choose to utter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When anything pleased her, Eve laughed—not so
much a laugh of amusement as a purr of satisfaction.
The unusual appealed to her, and beyond all doubt
Wynne Rendall was unusual. Hers were plucky eyes
too. They rested frankly, and seemed to read the meanings
of what they reflected. Eve had a broad forehead,
straight brows, and clean-cut, clearly defined features.
Her mouth was sweet and tolerant; to borrow from a
painter’s terminology, it was a beautifully drawn mouth.
One felt she would be very sure in all her dealings—analytic
and purposeful. Hers was not a present-day
face, but belonged rather to the period of the old Florentine
Masters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For quite a while these two young people surveyed
each other with calm appreciation, and presently Wynne
broke the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a new type to me,” he said—“a perplexing
type. I’ve seen you on canvas, but never in the flesh.
Something of Leonardo’s Lucretia! We might see more
of each other, I think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was about to speak again when the leading man
came through a door in the canvas scene and moved
toward them. In an instant Wynne pulled down the
corners of his mouth pathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh dear! I must go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why? Your scene is a long way ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know, but here’s K. G. If I stayed he might think
I wanted to talk to him—and I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve understood the feeling very well. Those whose
future is all to make are wary and resentful of patronage,
and often needlessly shun the society of others more
successful than themselves. None is more jealous of his
pride than the climber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She allowed Wynne to depart unhindered, and
presently the eminent K. G. came near enough to condescend
a “Good morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been talking to young Rendall?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A queer boy—quite a clever actor—quite! A good
sense of character!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Know him well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About five minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes—yes. Sadly opinionated! Notice it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has opinions, certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! Never get on—people with too many views.
He won’t learn—clever enough in himself, but won’t
learn from others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather thought he had learnt a good deal from
others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no—most inaccessible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does that mean he wouldn’t learn from you?” she
inquired, very frankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>K. G. looked down in mild surprise. Young ladies
who are “walking-on” should agree with and not interrogate
those lofty beings whose salaries are paid by
cheque. But this young lady ignored the principle, and
seemed to expect an answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he replied, very frankly. “Of course it’s his
own affair if he cares to ignore the advice of—well—”
Modesty forbade the mention of his own name, and he
finished the sentence by a gesture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course it is,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>K. G. frowned. The conversation was not proceeding
on orthodox lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, as I say, young men of that sort do not get
on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see why. Perhaps he thought you could
teach him nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the protective mother instinct compelled the
words. The remark annoyed K. G. excessively. It was
not, however, his habit to vent irritation upon a woman,
even though she might be its original cause, consequently
he attacked Wynne Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is a fellow who wants a good kicking, and has
never had it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man always wants to kick what he cannot understand,”
said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To defend some one who is absent from the attacks
of a third person is a sure basis upon which friendships
are established. When Eve returned to her little bed-sitting-room
after the rehearsal, Wynne Rendall occupied
a large share of her thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like him,” she said to herself. “He’s all wrong
in all sorts of ways, but there’s something tremendous
about him in spite of that—and I like him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell to wondering how he had arrived at what he
was, what queer turns of circumstance or inclination
had aged the youth from him. With quickening
sympathy she recalled his sunken cheeks, the nervous
sensitive movements of his hands and head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks as if he never had enough to eat. I’m sure
he doesn’t eat enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she laughed, for in her own existence eating
did not enter very largely. A salary of one pound one
shilling per week does not admit of extravagant <span class='it'>menus</span>.
A woman can keep the roses of her cheeks flowering
upon very little. With a man it is different. A man,
to be a man, must set his teeth in solid victuals, or nature
denied will deny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought over her exchange with the leading man,
and was glad she had stood up for Wynne. It offended
her that a fat, luxurious fellow should say what
he chose, and imagine himself immune from counter-attack
on account of his position in the company. She
would not have been at ease with her conscience if she
had acted otherwise. In the circumstances Eve did not
prosper well with her reading that night. “Heroes and
Hero Worship” was cast aside to make room for other
considerations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the rehearsal next day it was with almost a
proprietary interest she responded to Wynne’s flickering
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are making a reputation,” he said, and added,
“by the easiest way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What way is that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Being frank with your superiors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it easy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Assuredly—if you have the courage. Most people
are content to accept their superiors as being superior.
Invert the principle—tell an accepted success you consider
him an ass—and you create an immediate interest
in yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wasn’t my reason,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wasn’t it?” He seemed quite surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He annoyed me, and I showed him I was annoyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were sincere, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How queer of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why queer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know. It seems so odd to be sincere
with a man like that. Are you often sincere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Inside I am. Been at the stage long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is the beginning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The egg stage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me, where do you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A room—anywhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve no people, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None to whom I matter—or who matter to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. D’you know I was afraid you might have
been rich and comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve fingered a piece of her dress and held it out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eight-three a yard, and made at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are rich women who disguise themselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not one. I have king’s treasures, that is all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A row of books over your bed, h’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was clever,” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could guess the authors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meredith—Browning—Hardy—Wendell Holmes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pretty good—especially Meredith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t overdo Meredith—he is a cult, not an
author. You’re intricate—with the ‘Diana’ courage,
and that’s dangerous. If you care to borrow I have
some books. Come and choose a few.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I? I should like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come tonight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s the first night of the play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d forgotten. Well”—with a sudden impulse—“why
not after it is over?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rubbed his chin with his long, sensitive fingers,
and nodded approvingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d make a friend,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could say things very attractively when he chose.
The remark was a compliment to Eve and her sex.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s part ended with the first act, but he waited
at the stage door till the close of the play. Presently
Eve came out and joined him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very small she looked wrapped in a long brown coat,
with her hands tucked in the pockets. She wore a little
close-fitting hat which accentuated the oval of her
gravely piquant face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Through Covent Garden, if we walk. Be jollier
to walk, I think, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He suddenly remembered when last he had put the
same question, and almost flushed at the memory. Then,
as now, he had been seeking a friend. He had been
a long time finding one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, much,” said Eve. “I always walk back. I
like it, and it saves the pennies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like it, and try not to remember that it saves the
pennies,” he remarked whimsically. “ ’Tisn’t bad being
poor when one doesn’t mean to be poor for ever. I have
tremendous beliefs that this is only a passing stage,
haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A valley?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, which in passing through gives us the answer
to all manner of whys and wherefores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve nodded. “What a queer old street!” she said.
“I haven’t been this way before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a coffee stall at the corner where I buy
provender; that’s why I brought you. There it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stopped at the stall, with the proprietor of which
Wynne seemed on excellent terms, and bought some
hard-boiled eggs, “balls of chalk” as they are familiarly
called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend to every one that man is,” said Wynne as
they proceeded on their way. “Does all manner of
good turns to the queer folk whose business keeps ’em
abroad late. He lent me three suppers once, at a time
when I needed them badly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a glowing oven on wheels nearer his lodging
they bought baked potatoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Put one in each pocket. Finest things in the world
to keep your hands warm.” As she followed his advice
he nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the way. It’s a fire and a good dinner all
in one. I’ve a very great regard for a baked potato;
it’s the president of the republic of vegetables, as the
hot pie is the dowager queen of confectionery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call a hot pie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just that! They used to be cooked in the streets
in little portable ovens. Did you never meet a pieman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daresay not, for the last one died two years ago.
A fine fellow he was. I went to his funeral.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d love to have seen a real pieman. Didn’t Simple
Simon meet one going to a fair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So it’s said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now they’ve all gone for ever. How sad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell you what,” exclaimed Wynne, “there’s an old
man Richmond way who sells hot turnovers. When
the spring comes we might ’bus down there, have a
walk in the park, and munch turnovers in the night on
the way home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, let’s do that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very ordinary affairs assume a delicate outline when
approached in a romantic spirit. The idea of eating
turnovers on the top of a ’bus does not sound very attractive,
and yet to Wynne, as he suggested it, and to
Eve as she listened, the promised expedition seemed full
of the happiest possibilities. They felt the touch of a
spring breeze blowing in their hair, and saw the
whitey-green of the new leaves, and the blue sky turn
to a lavender in which the stars appeared. Almost they
could taste the good baked crust and the sour-sweet
apples of the midnight feast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you know,” said Eve, “I think, of all things in
the world, the most glorious are those we mean to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stopped before an old Queen Anne house, and
producing a latchkey Wynne unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Top floor,” he said, “and rather a climb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They mounted the creaky stairs, and he was puffing
gustily when they reached the top landing. For a
young man he seemed unduly exhausted. Striking a
light on his boot, he entered and lit a shaded lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take off your hat and I’ll get the fire going.
Look! I must have paid the rent, for it is actually
laid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve smiled as he went down on his knees before a
tiny basket grate, then let her gaze travel round the
room. Inset, in the damp-stained slanting roof, were
two gable windows, broad silled and littered with books
and papers. Before one of these was a writing table,
dilapidated but glorious with age; this, too, was liberally
sprinkled with half-written manuscripts, pens, cigarette
ends, and the jumble of odds and ends with which a man
surrounds himself. A small Jacobean table stood in the
middle of the uncarpeted floor, a tarnished copper bowl,
battered but still shapely, giving tone to its dark
fissured surface. Two age-worn grandfather chairs were
drawn up near the fire. In each recess in the walls was
a bookcase, piled ceiling-high with books. A couple of
Holbein prints, and an unframed Albrecht Dürer completed
the decoration. It was a shabby, unkempt room,
yet, like its owner, it possessed individuality and charm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like this,” said Eve. “I’m glad I came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like it. I thought you would—hoped so, too.
I’ve never shown it to any one else. It is good though,
isn’t it? Try that chair. I carried it back on my head
from a ragshop in Holloway Road, and having nearly
deprived me of life it gave it back to me in sweet repose.
Take off your coat first, won’t you? That’s
right. Don’t forget the ’taters though. Thanks! I’ll
put ’em on the trivet. Good. Thank God the fire means
to burn. D’you know sometimes I’ve almost cried when
it wouldn’t. I can’t lay a fire, and I loathe to be defeated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began wandering round the room and producing
plates and knives from unexpected quarters. Presently
he stopped and puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you think of a likely place to find the bread?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you see it last?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I have meals at all sorts of odd
times and places, so one loses track. Wait a minute,
though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disappeared into the bedroom and emerged with
a loaf and a saucer with butter on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Breakfasted while I was dressing,” he explained,
“or else I had supper in there over night. I don’t know
which—but let’s make a start.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They feasted very royally off bread and hard-boiled
eggs and hot potatoes and raspberry jam, followed by
a pot of tea. The tea they drank from little Chinese
Saki cups without handles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I only use these on the especialist occasions,” he
announced, adding with a smile, “In fact I have never
used them before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you many friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Have you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People with lots of friends don’t like me—but then
I don’t like them—so that’s that—isn’t it. Let’s draw
near the fire. The poor little thing means well, but it
can’t reach us at such a distance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they drew up their chairs and talked. They talked
of books, of dead men, and of great ambitions. Under
the influence of her society Wynne seemed to lose much
of his arrogance and cynicism. He spoke of the things
he loved naturally and with reverence. Ever and again
he would dart to the shelves for a volume and read some
passage to the point of the subject they had been discussing.
Then he would throw it aside and paraphrase
with a clear and almost inspired insight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One should always paraphrase,” he said. “One
should paraphrase one’s own thoughts and every one
else’s. It’s the sure way of getting down to basic facts.
If I were to produce a play of Shakespeare’s I should
make every actor translate his lines into colloquial schoolboy
English. Then we should know he had his meanings
right. Some glimmer of that necessity occurred to
me the first time I went to a theatre, but now I see how
absolutely essential it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The talk always led back to himself. His own ego
was the all-important factor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary wrong most people are in their
ideas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will you start to put them right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her keenly—on guard lest she should be
laughing at him. But the question was sincere enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know,” he answered. “I don’t believe
in beginnings—gradual ascent, ladder of fame, and all
that. Life to me is divided into two halves—the period
of finding out and the period of handing out. I don’t
intend to be a person who is beginning to be spoken of.
When I am spoken of it will be by every one—simultaneously.
In the meantime it is better to be obscure—and
absorbent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall have it too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the world’s sake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye-es—and for mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quarter after quarter boomed out from the neighbouring
clocks. It was after two when Eve rose and took her
coat from the nail on the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall I walk with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it isn’t far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well—I want to work too. But you’ll come
again, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course you may. You must. You’re an easy
person—easier than I’d have thought possible—you sort
of—don’t bother me. Take a Walter Pater with you.
Better for you than Meredith. Treat it gently, though;
I starved a whole week to buy that book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took the white-vellum bound volume, nodded,
and tucked it under her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Night. You are rather an admirable person.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. A girl is generally frightened to be in a man’s
rooms in the middle of the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It wouldn’t occur to me to be frightened of you,”
said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man who starved for a week to buy this.” She
touched the book under her arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some reason her gently spoken words piqued him,
and he replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet I am a man just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man but not the same,” she said, and, smiling,
passed out on to the landing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had descended the first flight before he moved
and followed her to the front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will walk back with you.” It was what any man
would have said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, please not. I had rather think of you as the
student working for the day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated—then, “Very well. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He retraced his steps slowly. The memory of her attitude
and her words puzzled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More like a boy,” he concluded, which if you think
it out was a very fine form of conceit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His thoughts wandered from his work, and he bit
his pen for a long, long while. His eyes rested unseeingly
on the black patch which was the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More like a boy—much more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded to convince himself. After all, the friendship
of a boy who is really a girl is very pleasant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never once did it cross his mind how entirely negligible
was the physical side of his nature. A man
whose brain works with febrile intensity night and day,
and whose earnings are scarcely sufficient to buy the
meanest fare, knows little or nothing of passionate callings.
Unlike your idle, over-fed fellow whose intellect
performs no greater task than finding excuses for bodily
indulgence, the student’s sensuality lies in words and
colour. His worst vice is the prostitution of an artistic
standard.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was the neuter quality in Wynne Rendall which
made possible the all-hour intimacy which came to exist
between Eve and himself. She would come to his rooms,
indifferent to time and convention, and stay far into the
night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes they conversed little, and then, while he
worked or wandered about in a seemingly aimless fashion,
seeking some cherished but elusive word, she would read,
curled up in the age-worn chair. When the talking
mood possessed him she would lay her book aside and
contribute endorsement or censure to his ideas. In this
respect her courage was boundless, for she never hesitated
to dispute with him when she felt he was at fault.
He would fight for his mental holdings to the last breath
of argument, then of a sudden swing round and say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know you are right—but how do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His extraordinary belief in himself filled her with a
queer mixture of distress and admiration, but the distress
was outweighed by the admiration and the joy she
took in their brain to brain fencing or accord. Their
talks, although embracing nearly every subject under the
sun, were, as a rule, impersonal, or rather impersonal
in so far as their relations to one another was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In common with many folk, Wynne thought more
highly of his lesser deeds than of his greater, and vaunted
them enthusiastically. He was inordinately proud of
his truculence and acerbity to men who were more successful
than himself, and took pleasure in recounting
the fine-edged verbal tools he had employed against
them. He was mortally offended when Eve told him
frankly the attitude was unworthy and easily misconstrued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They only think you are envious,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I envious of them? Good God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her frankness had its effect, however, for he modified
the characteristic, and no longer shouted “Yah”
at lesser intellects and longer purses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another change she brought about was the matter of
diet. Very drastically she quashed the nibbling habit
which with him had taken the place of meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wynne,” she said, “what did you have for breakfast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord knows. I don’t! Nothing, I expect.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to please me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he answered, “I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are starving yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What nonsense!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are. You won’t be able to stand the strain
if you don’t eat properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t if I do,” he replied. “How can I buy
books and pay rent and all that if I lavish my substance
on victuals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you spend a week on food?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I. Look! You haven’t seen this copy of
‘Erewhon,’ have you? It’s a first edition!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to answer my question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed his head petulantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t be like that,” he implored. “The world
is peopled with folk who worry about these matters;
let’s be away from them. You’ll want me to buy a
dinner-gong next so that half the street may know I am
sitting down to table.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I shall, for I want you to sit at table—regularly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught the word “regularly,” and played tunes
upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” said Eve, “and I like you for feeling that
way—but you are fighting against nature—not convention—and
that’s all wrong. We funny little things
who walk about on the world must follow certain laws—we
can’t help ourselves—and we may as well follow
them sensibly. We have to lie down and get up and
wash our faces and brush our hair and eat our dinners;
we have to—if we didn’t we should accomplish nothing.
It is foolish to fight with the ‘musts’ when there are
armies of ‘needn’t be’s’ to draw the sword against.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He snorted derisively and ridiculed prosaic philosophy.
When he had finished she calmly repeated her
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How much do you spend a week on food?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very reluctantly he produced a sheet of paper and
a pencil and scribbled a rough estimate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you give me the nine shillings and let me cater
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he said emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I spend money on a dinner when I can
stave off hunger with a stick of chocolate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t we make a common fund and have one
meal together each day. I’d cook it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His expression brightened instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would? You’d come each day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto her comings had been sporadic—too sporadic.
He had felt, when she was absent, the consciousness of
something lacking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like you to come here every day,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was willing to accept a routine of her society,
though rebelling against a time-table for meals. She
smiled as the thought crossed her mind, but to have
voiced it would have been to sacrifice the gains she
had made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you consent,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right; do what you will,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So every afternoon Eve cooked a meal over a grubby
little gas-ring, assisted by a methylated spirit stove, and
had the satisfaction of seeing her labours rewarded by
a slightly added tinge of colour to his cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In buying the food she contributed more toward the
cost than he, for in the matter of money he was strangely
unmindful. Frequently he forgot his weekly contribution
altogether, and returned home with some trifle
of china or an old print by way of alternative. On
these occasions it did not occur to him to question how
meals still appeared upon his table, and Eve would not
have told him for the world how hard it had been that
this should be so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Increasingly her thoughts centred on his welfare, and
her own personality took second place. Even her ambitions—and
they had been many and glorious—became
merged in the task of helping him to success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not taken into consideration the possibility
that she, too, was a climber at heart, and had set her
sails for the port where the dreams come true. He was
quite offended when one day she spoke of herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But can you act?” he staccatoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One day I shall,” she answered. “One day I shall
feel I know so much more than all the others—then I
shall act, and people will sit up and say so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think it unlikely?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know.” He fidgeted with a cup on the
mantelshelf. “It seemed you were echoing those things
which I say to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have thoughts in common.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t admit it. There is no common currency in
thoughts or ideas. To me parallel lines are antagonistic
lines. Why should you want to act?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to express myself as strongly as you do. I
want to succeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like women who succeed. Why should you
succeed? Where’s the necessity—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Born in me,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His words for the moment had hurt her bitterly, but
the subtler side of her nature took comfort from the almost
childishly petulant tone in which he had spoken
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The necessity is born by the things around you,” he
said. “They are the impulses toward success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, that’s true. Perhaps it was the wretched drabness
of my surroundings which fired the impulse in me.
We haven’t talked to each other of our people, you and
I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never think back,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, because it’s the impetus to think forward.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her critically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might have come from princely stock by the
look of you. You haven’t the seeming of the drab.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I did; but it was the inbred collapsed
finish of the good stock. My father idled backward
to the slums—my mother was gentle, but that was all.
He was dead before I could remember. Oh, that dreadful
back-street life! You can’t understand. We were
only a little removed from the gossipy-doorstep folk
who talk of a neighbour’s confinement as they lean on
the rickety railings. We played with their children,
my sister and I, bought from their horrid mean shops—went
to the same wretched school. Oh! how I hated
it all—the miserable rooms, the bargaining for food, the
squabbles, and the never-ending economy and thrift.
Grey—grey—grey! I used to lash a purple whiptop
at the corner of the street, and pray sometimes a great
chariot of fire would snatch me up into the skies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Wynne’s habit to ignore central ideas in
another’s conversation, hence the question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why a <span class='it'>purple</span> top?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly know—but it was <span class='it'>always</span> purple. I kept a
patch of purple on my horizon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her queerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Royal Purple. Somehow it stands out as the
colour which rises above all sordidness. Can’t explain
it otherwise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “I know what you mean. Strange you
should feel like that, too.” The “too” was scarcely
audible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was ever so little I had that feeling, and
it has grown up with me. I used to believe that a purple
goodness lined the great clouds above and the hilltops
of my imagination. I could travel in my imagination,
too. Just close my eyes and say to myself: Now the
world is falling away, and I’m floating upwards, and I
would pass above all the slates and see down all the
chimneys until the houses became cities, and the cities
grey marks on the green earth—and the rivers twisted
silver wires which curled from the mountains to the
sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should meet Uncle Clem,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man who thinks that way. But what is it like
up there in the clouds?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, strangely, it isn’t very different—only
fuller. Just as if one went up discontented and
found contentment in what one had left behind. I
used to think this was because my imagination couldn’t
picture a better state, but I believe that no longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The climb is for nothing, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, for the climb proves that what you sought
is the best of what you left behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m! Sometimes,” he said. “You have queer
notions. Have you found out what is the best of your
possessions?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know them by heart, yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why by heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am a woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and sometimes, I think, just like any other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once I tried to define my motives—can you define
yours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want a place in the sun—want it tremendously.
I want to be able to think and feel and move among
lovely things and people. I have given away twenty
years to sordidness, and all I have earned is appreciation
of the beautiful. I want to live the beautiful now,
and rise above the trivial bother of a washpail and a
gas-ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mammon, Mammon,” cried Wynne, for want of a
better thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no. Don’t think I crave for money, for it isn’t
so; but one must have money if one is never to think
of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t half the sorrow in the world traceable to
such little causes as an extra halfpenny on a quartern
of bread?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not untrue,” Wynne nodded. His eyes fell on
the dirty gas-ring of the grate, and he frowned. “Why
do you come here, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you know?” she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It’s squalid enough!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it is because you are the first real person I
have ever met outside the cover of a book.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I give you something, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A great deal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A modesty seized him, touched with self-reproach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only because it pleases me,” he said, brusquely.
“The giving is done by you. That much I realize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad—and I’m glad to give.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a woman’s life is to give—that’s natural law—the
only kind of law worth accepting.” He hesitated—then,
“Are you satisfied to give?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled her wise, intricate smile, and he did not
wait for the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You never smile as you should,” he reproached.
“Yours is a thinking smile—perplexing. Do you never
smile or laugh from sheer happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps I have never yet been sheerly happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would make you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t found out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to know. If you smiled for me you
would seem less remote.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I remote?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—remote is the word.” He looked at her
fixedly, then shook himself and began to pace up and
down the room. When next he spoke his voice was
querulous and irritable:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have been working all this while. The
train of my thoughts is all upset—disordered. It is unlike
you to disturb me. I’ve lost an hour. Tomorrow
I must work all day—alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go back to yourself,” she said, gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not leave at once, but half an hour later
he looked up and saw she was buttoning her coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had better,” she said; and at the door—“I come
here too often, perhaps. It is selfish of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I like you to be here—I want you here. I
meant nothing—only I’m a little keyed up and
worried. I don’t know why.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” said Eve. “Just for tomorrow I’ll
stay away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but it is good sometimes to do what one doesn’t
want. G’bye.” And she was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night, as he lay in bed, the same feeling of
self-reproach which had sprung into being for an instant
during their talk came back to him heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do I do for her? Nothing.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The thought awoke with him next day, and seemed
to write itself across the pages of his manuscript. He
could not concentrate, and the ink on his dipped pen
dried times without number, and not a line was committed
to the paper. The hour for their united meal
came, and with it a feeling of loneliness and disappointment.
He made no attempt to set the table for
himself, but sat staring dully at the criss-cross lines
of the window transoms, fiddling aimlessly with the
books and papers before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he thought he would go out, but changed his
mind, and threw his hat aside before he had reached
the door of the room. He tried to read, but the words
were meaningless and confused, and conveyed nothing
to his mind, so he dropped the book to the floor and
fell back to the fruitless staring again. The words she
had spoken about her childhood recurred, and with the
startling reproductive faculty which he possessed he
was able to picture it all very vividly. He could almost
visualize the cheap short dress she would have
worn when, years before, she lashed her purple top
at the corner of that grey side street. The houses there
would have narrow and worn steps leading down to
the pavement; they would have mean areas, and windows
repaired with gelatine lozenges. One of the lodgers
would boast a row of geranium pots on the window-sill,
stayed from falling by a slack string. No flowers
would bloom in those pots—a few atrophied leaves on
a brown stalk would be the only reward of the desultory
waterings. In the yards at the back queer, shapeless
garments would flap and fill upon a line, and gaunt
cats would creep along the sooty walls. There would
be querulous voices somewhere raised in argument or
rebuke, and the shrill cries of children at unfriendly
games. On Sundays vulgar youths with button-holes
would loaf by the letter-box at the street corner, making
eyes and blowing coarse kisses to the giggling girls
who warily congregated on the far side. At times
there would be chasings, slaps, and rough-and-tumble
courtships. Old men without coats would blink and
smoke complacently on the doorsteps, and women
would nod and whisper of their misfortunes and their
fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She came from there—untouched by it all,”
thought Wynne. “She deserves her place in the sun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strange restlessness seized him, and he started to
pace up and down.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne arrived at the theatre earlier than usual that
night, and met Eve in one of the corridors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I haven’t worked all day—I
couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry. What have you done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walked about—and thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of you mostly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you? I’m glad. I wanted you to think of
me today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why today?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty-one!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed rather sad. Twenty-one is a great birthday.
Had she been an earl’s daughter there would
have been laughter and dancing in the hall that night—white
flowers and scarlet in happy clusters everywhere.
There would have been pearls from her father,
and a dream dress to wear. Wax candles would have
glittered the silver on the board, and pink-coated huntsmen
would have led her to the dance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed rather sad she should be walking-on in a
crowd to earn three shillings and sixpence. And with
this reflection there came to Wynne an idea—one of
the first that did not actually concern himself. It
smote him gloriously, and sent a pulsation of delight
throbbing through his veins. But all he said was:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will come to the rooms after the play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated. “I said I would not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s your birthday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, if I shan’t disturb you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even if you do, I want you to come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. Will you wait for me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Follow me round. I’ve something to do first.
Here, take a key and keep it if you will. I give you
the freedom of the rooms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you’d wait,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sorry,” he replied, shaking his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, a birthday means very little to a man,”
thought Eve. Yet she was disappointed he had refused
so small a service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When his scene was over, Wynne dressed quickly
and hurried from the theatre. In his pocket was a
sum of six shillings and threepence. He counted it
by touch as he walked down Maiden Lane and struck
across Covent Garden. Before a modest wine shop
in Endell Street he stopped and considered. In the
window was a pyramid of champagne bottles, the base
composed of magnums, the first tier of quarts, the
second of pints, and, resting proudly on top, a single
half-pint. Each size was carefully priced, even the
tiny bottle showing a ticket on which was printed,
“Two shillings and eightpence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne squared his shoulders and entered the shop
with an air of some importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This Dry Royal,” he said, “is it a wine you can
recommend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a very drinkable wine,” replied the merchant.
“Of course it does not compare⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Wynne interrupted with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take one of the half-pints to sample.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no half-pints.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is one in the window.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not for sale.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no demand for that size.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am supplying the demand.” His tone was irritatingly
precise, and the merchant was offended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I regret, sir, I cannot undertake to spoil my window
dressing for so small an order.” He spoke with finality
that could not be misconstrued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good God!” exclaimed Wynne. “You call it a
small order? It is nearly half of all I possess. Am
I to be cheated of a celebration for the sake of your
damned ideas of symmetry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His very genuine concern excited interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be very sorry to cheat you of anything,”
came the answer in a more kindly voice. “Perhaps if
you would explain⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What explanation is needed? Why does any one
buy champagne except to celebrate an event? Must
I sacrifice the desire to please and the hope of giving
a sparkle of happiness because your hide-bound conventions
won’t let you knock the top off a triangle? Is
the expression of a kindly wish to be nullified because
my worldly wealth won’t run to a pint? Would you
decline to serve a rich man with a quart because you
stock magnums? There’s no damned sense of justice
in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It so happened there were warm springs in the heart
of the little Endell Street wine merchant—and imagination
too. As he listened to this intemperate outburst
he pictured very vividly the event which the small
gold-braided bottle was destined to enliven. A man
does not spend half his belongings for no purpose, and
accordingly he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never wish to disappoint a customer, sir. If you
would accept a pint for the price of the half, you would
be doing me a service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the rancour had not abated, and Wynne replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is a celebration—not a damned charity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see—of course not. Please forgive me,” said the
little man, and opening a panelled door he took the
tiny bottle from the top of the pyramid and wrapped
it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne placed two shillings and eightpence on the
counter, pocketed the parcel, and walked to the door.
Arrived there, he turned and came back with an outstretched
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a good sort,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, sir, and a very merry evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They shook hands warmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At a very special fruiterer’s in Southampton Row
Wynne bought a quarter of a pound of hothouse grapes,
and argued fiercely with the shop assistant who did
not consider the purchase warranted placing the fruit
on vine leaves in a basket. He next made his way to a
confectioner’s, and forced an entrance as they were
putting up the shutters. Here he had a windfall, and
secured a small but beautifully iced cake for a shilling,
on the double account of the lateness of the hour and
a slight crack in the icing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the pavement outside he counted what remained
of his original capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One and tenpence—good!” he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The red and green lights of a chemist lured him to
enter, and he emerged, after a period of exquisite indecision,
with two elegant packages—one containing a
tablet of soap, and the other a tiny bottle of perfume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Carrying his treasures with prodigious care he hastened
toward his rooms, but had hardly covered half
the distance when an appalling thought occurred to him.
Under the weight of it he stopped short, and beat his
forehead with a closed fist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve forgotten the candles,” he gasped. “The fairy
candles—the twenty-one candles!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without those twenty-one candles the whole affair
would be flat and meaningless. In being able to obtain
them reposed the success of the scheme. He tried
an oilshop, but without success—he tried another with
the same result.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God!” he exclaimed in an ecstasy of anxiety,
“where can I get the things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the good angel who listens for such prayers
heard, and sent toward him a small boy of pleasing
exterior who whistled gaily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” said Wynne, “ever had a Christmas-tree?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy grinned and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One with candles on it, I mean—coloured candles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yus, it was a proper tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want some candles—want ’em tremendously.
Know where I could get some?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Appealed to as a specialist, the urchin adopted a
professional mien, and paused for consideration. Eventually
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dad got ours at Dawes’s, rahnd the street. She’s
still got some, ’cos my mate, Joe, bought one for his
bull’s-eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Round which street?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne waited for no more, and broke into a run.
By a kindly Providence Mrs. Dawes had not put up
the shutters, being a lady who traded sweets to little
voyagers whose parents were not over particular as to
the hours they kept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dessay I could lay my ’and on a few,” she replied
to Wynne’s fervent appeal, “though it isn’t the season
for them, you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that she opened, or rattled, an incredible number
of wrong boxes, taken from beneath the counter. The
sweat had beaded Wynne’s forehead when at last she
discovered what she had been seeking. She did not
appear to be in any hurry, and conversed on technical
subjects during the search.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t the sale for coloured candles that there
used to be. Of course you may say as it is more the
peg-top season, and that might account for it; but it
doesn’t—not altogether, that is. Putting the Christmas
trade on one side, boys don’t go for bull’s-eye
lanterns as once they did—no, nor Chinese neither. It’s
all iron ’oops, or roller skates nowadays, as you may
say. Why, I dessay I sell as much as ten or a dozen
’oops a week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you indeed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite that. Let’s see! Candles! Ah, I think this
is them.” And it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God!” exclaimed Wynne. “I want twenty-one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He watched in an agony of suspense as she turned
out precisely that number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Five a penny,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord!” he gasped. “I’ve only fourpence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can pay me the odd farthing when you are
passing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Greatly to the good lady’s surprise the extraordinary
young man leant across the counter and planted a kiss
upon her ample cheek, then seizing his purchases raced
from the shop and scuttled down the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well I never!” she exclaimed—“must be a bit
mad.” But nevertheless she rubbed the spot where the
kiss had fallen with a kindly touch.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Probably for the first time in his life Wynne felt
the need of fine linen. It is a sorry happening to lay
choice dishes on a bare board. A flash of memory provided
an alternative, and he unearthed a roll of white
wallpaper from a cupboard. Mindful of a trick performed
by small boys at gallery doors, he folded and
tore the paper to a rough presentment of a lace cloth.
Quite imposing it looked upon the black surface of the
old oak table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the rim of a fine, but much-riveted blue-and-white
plate he waxed the twenty-one candles, and in the
centre, pedestalled upon an inverted soap-dish, he stood
the birthday cake. The champagne and some glasses
were placed on one side of this setpiece, the grapes on
the other, while before it, squarely and precisely laid,
were the two beautifully tied parcels of soap and scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So wrapped up was he in the exquisite pleasure of
his preparations that he was quite insensible to the
deliberate symmetry he had brought about—a circumstance
which may prove a great deal, or nothing at all.
When he had done he fell back and surveyed his handiwork
as an artist before a masterpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And outside rumbled the voices of the clocks saying
the hour was eleven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven! She will be here in a moment,” he thought.
A sudden nervousness seized him. He did not know
why or what it was about. He touched his pocket to
be sure the matches were there. He wondered if she
were all right, and had crossed Long Acre and Oxford
Street safely—they were busiest in theatre traffic at
that hour, and private cars and taxis paid little heed
to pedestrians. It would be so easy for her to be knocked
down and run over. He could picture the curious,
jostling crowds that would gather round, the blue helmets
of the police in the centre—and the gaunt ambulance
which would appear from nowhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! What a fool I am,” he exclaimed. “She’s
all right—of course she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, despite this guarantee of her safety, thoughts
of possible disaster raced across his mind. Memory
of his visit to the Morgue in Paris arose and would
not be banished. He recalled what he had said that
day: “Death is so horribly conclusive.” Conclusive!
Suppose it were visited upon her?—something would
die in him, too. He asked himself what that something
would be, but could find no answer. It would
be something so lately come to life that he did not
know it well enough to name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more his eyes fell upon the table, and the
fears vanished. Of course she would come—of course
nothing would happen to her. Even though it were
against her will, she would be drawn by what he had
prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He blew out the lamp, and crossing the room opened
the window and leant over the sill to wait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sweet night, starred and silent. Smoke rose
ghostily from the silhouetted stacks, and a faint, murmurous
wind, which seemed to have stolen from a
Devon lane, touched his hair to movement. North,
south, east, and west stretched the roofs of London, and
in imagination he could hear the soft rustle as the
dwellers beneath tucked themselves in for the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A hundred times before he had leant out, as now,
with thoughts which ran on the groundlings who ate
and slept and worked and squabbled beneath that army
of stacks and slates; and how, one day, his name should
come to be as familiar with them as the pictures hanging
on their walls. But tonight his feelings were different.
He conceived these people in their relation to
each other and not to himself. In each and all those
myriad abiding-places there would be folk with gentle
thoughts and kindly desires, even as his were then.
They would be linked together by the common tie of
doing something to please. Never before had it occurred
to him that in pleasing another happiness was born
in oneself. Hitherto he had only thought to please
by the nimbleness of his artistry—the perfection of
a style, the ability to express; but now he saw the surer
way was to appeal to the heart—to minister to the
true sentiment—to hand over sincerity from one’s simple
best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A footfall below, and the glimpse of a grey figure
in the light of the street-lamp, brought him to immediate
action. He drew back from the window, and,
trembling with excitement, put a match to the circle
of coloured candles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A ring of fire leapt into being—a tiny flame for every
year of her in whose honour they were burnt in offering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing behind the lights, and almost invisible in
the twinkling glare, Wynne waited breathlessly for the
door to open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was drawing off her gloves as she came into the
room, but she stopped, and her hands fell gently to
her sides. Her eyes rested on every detail of the little
scene, hovering over it with an exquisite increase of
lustre. And slowly her lips broke into a smile of the
purest child-happiness, as, with a little catch in her
voice, she breathed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How lovely and dear of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hard to find a reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re pleased?” he said. “I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleased! Look! there are two presents for me—real
champagne, with its livery all bright and goldy—and
the bloom on the grapes, it’s—that’s a proper
birthday cake, with ‘marzi’ inside—and twenty-one
candles because I am twenty-one years old today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held out her hand, and he came to her and took
it in one of his. For quite a while they stood in
silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is my first real birthday, and you’ve thought
of it all for me. Oh, it is wonderful, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have done something more wonderful for me,”
he said, in a voice that seemed unlike his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You smiled for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you made me utterly happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you think—I could—go on making you happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time she raised her eyes from the fairy
candles to meet his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reply was characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—for I am happier now than I have ever been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed understandingly, and caressed his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, here!” he said. “Sit down, I want to talk.”
He almost thrust her into the chair and settled himself
upon the arm. “All of a sudden you have become
something that I want—must have. Spiritually I want
you near me—you’re—you’re essential. Without you
I am incomplete. If I lost you I should lose more than
you—far more. D’you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Together we could reach any heights, you and I,
for you give me the atmosphere I need—the right
essence. I used to believe the line, ‘He travels fastest
who travels alone,’ but now I scout it—it’s lost its
truth for me. I believe you are wrapped up in my
happiness and my success; I believe without you they
would be in jeopardy—in danger. D’you care for me
well enough to take me on those terms?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to have your happiness, Wynne, and
your success—I want that to be a true dream.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll accept your spiritual offer—and give you all
in return. But won’t you say just one thing more?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have I left unsaid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you say you loved me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he replied; “but, in God’s name, I believe I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said, with a mother’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke away from her and started to pace the room
feverishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come back,” she pleaded. “I am so proud of that
belief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw up his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was honest enough to offer all I possessed,” he
cried. “A man would have taken you in his arms.
God! I’m only half a man—a starveling—! You are
beautiful—beautiful to me—beautiful—subtle—desirable—but
I haven’t a shred of passion in my half-starved
body.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours is the better half, dear. The spirit counts,
and the greatest possession a woman can have is all that
her man can give. Let us keep our spirits bright together.”
She rose, and he came toward her, and suddenly
his face lost its tragic look, and the lines at the
corners of his mouth pulled down in a whimsical smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a triumph for Plato!” he said. “When shall
it be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled back at him. “Whenever you wish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very delicious she looked in the dancing fairy light.
A strangely new and elemental impulse seized him, and
he gripped her shoulders fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are wonderful,” he said. “We’ll work together
for the Day. The Day shall be our <span class='it'>real</span> wedding;
till then—partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall help to make a success, and—a man; and
when I’m a man I shall seek a man’s reward. We’ll
pledge that! Come, let’s feast before the candles burn
low.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tiny bottle of champagne popped bravely, and the
wine tinkled against the glass.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span><h1>PART SIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>“HE TRAVELS FASTEST—</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>They were on their way to the registrar’s when
Wynne stopped short and exclaimed, “Of
course!” Then, in answer to an arched-brow
inquiry from Eve: “Would you like to meet some one
nice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have,” she smiled, for it was their wedding day,
and future wives and husbands say pleasant things to
each other on their wedding days, even though sometimes
they forget to do so afterwards.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A man—in fact, an uncle of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Clem?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. How did you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Guessed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I spoken of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to meet him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I do too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know where he lives though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s try a telephone directory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They did—and successfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He would live in Kensington Square,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you never been to see him before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you never have that feeling of wanting to keep
something back? How can I explain? If you are
thirsty and at last you are within reach of a drink, have
you never waited awhile instead of snatching it to your
lips?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then that’s why. Only here and there has he entered
my life, and somehow each time I felt the better
for him. I’m not a very grateful individual, but I’m
grateful to Uncle Clem—and I’m grateful <span class='it'>for</span> Uncle
Clem, too. He sees things very agreeably. When I was
a child I thought him a god—and I haven’t altogether
outgrown that feeling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why do you avoid him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When one goes before the Presence one likes to have
something to show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He touched her hand lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Today I have something to show.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They climbed to the top of a bright red ’bus and
journeyed to Kensington. At the church they descended,
and dipped into the little side street which leads
to the Queen Anne houses of Kensington Square.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a copper knocker on the door of Uncle
Clem’s abode, with which Wynne very bravely tattooed
his arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Rendall is in,” admitted the manservant
who answered the summons. “Was he expecting you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens! no,” said Wynne. “I’m his nephew—but
let him find out for himself. We shouldn’t pocket the
spoons if you invited us to come inside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man smiled. “I recognize the relationship in
your speech, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened the door of a white-panelled room, and,
when they had entered, mounted the stairs to inform his
master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, isn’t it?” said Wynne, his eyes roaming over
the comfortable disorder and beautiful appointments.
“Everything right. Hullo!” He halted abruptly before
a large framed canvas on one of the walls, “The
Faun and the Villagers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was standing so when the door opened, and Uncle
Clem, dressed in quilted smoking jacket and a pair of
ultra vermilion slippers, came in. He paused a moment,
then out rang his voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! The young fellow! Ain’t dead, then? Let’s
look at you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne met the full smack of the descending hand in
his open palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he laughed. “Look here, instead,” and
pivoted Uncle Clem so that Eve came in his line of sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Splendid!” said Clem, moving to meet her. “Used
to tell him he’d do no good until he fell in love. May
I kiss her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t ask me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, may I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he did, saying thereafter:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First rate! I like it immensely. Sit down—take
off your hat, or whatever you do to feel at home. That’s
the way. Now let’s hear all about it. Are you married—or
going to be? I see—going to be—no ring. Splendid!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here’s the ring,” said Wynne. “It will be worn
for the first time today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Today! Today the best day in all the year! And
you came to see me on the way to the church. Fine!
Y’know, there is something in ’im after all, even though
he’s devilish sporadic in coming to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s saving you up for the good time ahead,” said
Eve; “and I can see why, now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then give up seeing why, little lady. What’s your
name, by the way? What is her name, young fellar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eve—couldn’t be better. What was I saying? Ah,
yes. Give up seeing <span class='it'>why</span> and come and see <span class='it'>me</span> instead.
Rotten policy to save! (never saved a penny in my
life). Fatal to save! Find out, when it’s too late,
don’t want what you’ve been saving for—outgrown
your impulses. Buried with your bankbook, and every
one glad you’re dead. No—no. Spend while you are
young. Get a hold on all the friendship and all the
love within reach—and then, why then, when you’re
old, at least memories will be yours as comforters.
You agree, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I agree,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All or nothing,” replied Wynne. “And I had
rather keep the ‘nothing’ till I can claim the ‘all.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good stars!” exclaimed Clem. “What a speech for
a wedding day!” Then, catching a glimpse of the
growing colour on Eve’s cheeks:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t heed me, my dear. I’ve a reputation for
saying things which, in the vernacular, I didn’t ought.
But a man who speaks of nothing on his wedding
day—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne hesitated, then:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This isn’t altogether our wedding day,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Today she and I are becoming—legalized partners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the devil are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Partners. We shall join forces, she and I, and
work together for success—think of, live for, and concentrate
on that goal. Afterwards we⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Uncle Clem would not let him finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rank folly!” he cried, jumping to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve read your Plato!” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plato be damned! Well enough for an old philosopher
to mumble his repressive theories from a dead
log in the market-place—but for you at twenty-what-ever-it-may-be,
tss—madness—rot—folly! My dear,
dear girl, for God’s sake, tell him not to talk such utter
damn nonsense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You haven’t quite understood,” said Eve, very
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He speaks of success and denies love—he places
success before love. Doesn’t he know—? Here! don’t
you know,” twisting suddenly round, “that love is
the only success worth having—that success is only
possible through love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is the reward,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not. It is no more the reward than rain is a
reward to the ground, or air is a reward to the lungs.
Love is a necessity—a primary necessity—and the fountain
of all inspiration. If you can’t realize that, don’t
marry—you have no right to marry. Don’t marry him,
my dear. Keep away from him till he comes to his
proper senses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think we have a greater knowledge,” said Wynne,
moving to Eve’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I think you have no knowledge whatsoever—that
you are throttling it at the main. Partners!”
he threw up his head. “Oh, can’t you see what partners
means—what it amounts to in practice? A staling
of each other for each other—that’s all. A mutual
day-by-day loss of conceit and regard. You can see
it in the City, or wherever you choose to look. Listen
to what any man says of his partner: ‘He’s all right,
but getting old—losing his grip—isn’t the man he was,’
so on and so forth. And why is it? Because they have
no closer tie than their signatures on a piece of paper.
Nature admits of no lasting partnership between man
and woman save one—love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even that partnership is sometimes dissolved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By fools, yes, and by the blind, but not by those
who can see. Knowledge is the keystone which holds
up the archway of heaven, my boy—knowledge which
has sprung from love. I may be no more than a talkative
old bachelor, but, by God! I know that to be true.
There are few enough spirits on this earthy old world
of ours, and only through love comes the power to know
them each by name.” He stopped and fiddled with
a pipe on the mantelshelf. “This is a disappointment
to me—a big disappointment. I’d looked to you young
folk to open your hearts and tell me what was inside,
and, instead, I’ve done all the talking, and told you
what I think they ought to contain, and perhaps
offended you both into the bargain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you haven’t,” said Eve. “I like you for
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I were offended,” said Wynne, “I should not
ask you to come to the wedding—and I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not I,” he said. “I’m an idealist—not a business
man. I’d as soon watch a stockbroker signing
scrip.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the doorstep, a few moments later, he touched
Eve’s arm and whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Run away—don’t do it—run away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head. “I love him,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence she and Wynne walked to the High Street
and turned into Kensington Gardens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s losing his grip—not the man he was—getting
old,” quoted Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” she answered, “he is younger than we
are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell upon a second silence, then very suddenly
Wynne said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you unhappy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you doubtful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do believe in me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s—it’s not much of a wedding for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s all the future.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He was wrong, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the future is to be ours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shall be ours. What’s it matter if we grope
along the flats if at last we jump to the mountain top
together?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I put all my faith in that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall never regret it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hung close upon his arm. “No, you won’t let
me regret it, will you? You won’t <span class='it'>ever</span> let me regret
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know, when you make that leap to the
mountain top, that my arm will be through yours
as it is now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will be then. I shall want to show my treasures
to the world,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her mouth broke into a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing else matters,” she said.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A registrar is not, as a rule, an enlivening person.
He is a dealer in extremities—to him a birth or a death
is merely a matter of so many words written upon a
page, and a marriage is no greater affair than a union
of two people brought together for the purpose of providing
him with subjects for his more serious offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The particular registrar who was responsible for making
Wynne and Eve man and wife was no exception to
the rule. He proved to be a man of boundless melancholy,
who recited the necessary passages with a gloom
of intonation better befitting a burial than a bridal. His
distress was acute in that they had failed to import
the required witnesses—and, indeed, at one time he
seemed disposed to deny them the privileges of his
powers. The apartment in which the ceremony took
place smelt disagreeably from lack of ventilation, and
the newly-wed pair were thankful to come into the
sunshine of the street outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So great was the oppression produced that neither
one nor the other felt capable of saying a word, and
it was only by a mighty effort Wynne was able to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve pressed his hand, and nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather beastly, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t seem very real, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And she replied, “Would you kiss me just to make
it seem more real?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather awkwardly he stooped and brushed her cheek
with a kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better?” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A bit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to speak rather fast:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, what’s it matter? This is only the beginning.
We’ll count today as any other day—a working
day. I’m no more to you—or you to me—beyond
the sharing of a single name and a single roof. We
won’t spoil our future by any foretaste of its good.
Do you agree?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I agree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then shake hands, partner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you and let you win,” said Eve, as she
laid her hand on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the doors of the British Museum they nodded a
temporary farewell. He entered and made his way to
the reading-room, and she walked home alone.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The moonlight streamed through the slanting window,
pitching a dim ray upon Wynne as he lay asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was dark in the lonely corner, on the far side
of the room, where, very faintly, the outline of a slim
white figure could be seen—a figure hugging her knees
and resting her chin upon them. Very quiet it was—just
the rise and fall of a man’s breathing and the
muted, humming noises of the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clocks of the City coughed and jarred the hour
of three.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the still white figure moved, and, bare-footed,
crossed the floor between the two beds. For
a little while she stood looking down upon the sleeping
man; then, in answer to a human impulse too
gentle, and yet too strong to be denied, stooped and
laid her head beside his upon the pillow. Her breath
was warm upon his cheek, but he made no movement;
her hair tressed upon his arm, but it did not quicken
to life and fold around her, as a husband’s might;
her lips were almost touching his, but he did not move
that they might meet in the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a little catch in her throat Eve lifted herself
and crossed to the lonely shadows beneath the sloping
roof.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“May I read these?” asked Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had unearthed a box full of old manuscripts he
had written and cast aside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Burn ’em, if you like,” he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She chose one from the pile, saying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have they been sent anywhere?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh yes, a few have been the round. They are true
to the boomerang type, for they always returned to the
point of departure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She curled herself in the big armchair and began
to read. The breakfast things had been washed up,
the beds made, and the rooms tidied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was an article she had chosen, and the subject
was “Education.” Wynne had a singularly marked
style of his own—his sentences were crisp and incisive,
his views original and striking. When he chose he
could write with a degree of tenderness that was infinitely
appealing; but in odd contrast to this mood, and
usually in immediate proximity to his most happy
expressed phrases, occurred passages of satire and mordant
wit which detracted immeasurably from the charm
of the whole. They stood out like blots upon the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same conditions prevailed in each of the other
manuscripts which Eve read, with the result that the
fine susceptibilities which had been awakened by his
best, were wounded by the ill-humour of his worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you give all the butterflies stings?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question pleased him, and he smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Aren’t they mostly well deserved?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By whom?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The public.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had it in mind to say that it was not the public
who felt the sting, but, instead, she replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I copy these out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did, and, with certain reservations and omissions,
dispatched them to the kind of periodical which
might be interested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Three weeks later a letter arrived from <span class='it'>The Forum</span>
accepting the essay on Education. “Payment of ten
guineas will be made on publication,” said the letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But they refused it before!” exclaimed Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I made a few cuts, and altered it a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His forehead flew into straight creases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where? What did you cut?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head and paced up and down the room.
“Heavens above!” he reproached. “Those were the
best passages.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They weren’t. They were bad, and destructive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Revolutionary, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wrong sort of revolution.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all. I wrote them with a purpose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the purpose was wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank God you cut them and not I. I should
esteem myself a coward if I had done that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t. You will never heal by throwing vitriol.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne’s tenacity was tremendous, and he fought
for every inch of ground before conceding it. The
lesson, however, did him good, and thereafter, if not
always with the best grace, he submitted his writings
to her for approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve had a very sure literary sense, and her criticisms
were as just as they were courageous. Wynne
could never gauge to what extent a reader will allow
the scourge of wit to fall upon his shoulders, but Eve,
by some peculiar insight of her own, knew this to a
nicety, and little by little forced him to her way of
seeing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As his writings began to be accepted he came to
a silent acknowledgment of the value of her decisions,
and, subconsciously, his mind, in certain directions,
ran parallel with hers. By his sharp acquisitive
sense he came to know how she arrived at her reasoning,
and in learning this, the necessity to appeal to
her diminished correspondingly. Once an idea was
firmly implanted it became a part of his being, and
very soon his pen lost its jagged edge and ran more
smoothly over the pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For nearly a year the partners worked together,
each in their separate spheres, to the common end of
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That his mind might go free and unworried wheresoever
it willed, Eve cooked and darned, and kept
his house in order. It was a grey enough life, with
little to raise it from the ruck of sordid domesticity.
To all intent and purpose she was a general servant,
privileged at rare intervals to wash her hands, sit at
her master’s table and share his speech. Her reward
was to hear an echo of some of her sweetness in his
writings, and to see the results of her gentle care in
his looks and bearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had more colour, his step was springier than in
the days before they had met, and this added vitality
he converted into longer hours of labour. He never
spared himself or relaxed, and his tireless energy, perseverance,
and concentration were abnormal. Except
when he needed her advice he appeared to be wholly
detached, and scarcely aware of her presence. The
cramped conditions in which they lived made it very
difficult for Eve to conduct her household duties without
disturbing him. He was very sensitive and exacting,
and the sound of a rattled teacup would throw
him out of line. Not the least of Eve’s achievement
was the manner in which she contrived to do everything
that was needful without disturbance, and at the
same time to be ever ready to lay all aside in case he
should want her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man will always give or find occupation for a
woman, and in some small way or another the whole of
Eve’s time was taken up in meeting his needs and wishes.
She was obliged to forego many of the happy book
hours she used to spend in order that the wheels could
run smoothly and silently. This in itself was a very
great sacrifice, for she had loved her reading, and grubbing
with pots and pans, or bargaining with tradesfolk,
was a sorry substitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s only for a while,” she comforted herself.
“One day—” and her thoughts floated out to the sun-lit
hills and the sweeping purple heather of the moors.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One evening Wynne arrived home and announced that
he had left the stage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to write a play,” he said, “and I shall
want all my time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had not taken into consideration that with the
loss of his theatre salary their finances would be seriously
crippled. Of late there had been rather more
money than usual, and Eve had entertained the hope
of engaging a maid to come in and do the rougher
work, but with this announcement that happy prospect
took immediate wings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A play would certainly take several weeks to write,
and probably months or even years to place. In the
meantime there were three or four outstanding sales
of stories and articles which would realize a total of
thirty or forty pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet, although these considerations arose very clearly
in Eve’s mind, she only nodded and expressed enthusiasm
for the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, with a great deal of energy and intention,
Wynne attacked the play, and Eve rolled up her sleeves
and washed the greasy plates, and blacked the stove
and cooked the meals, and did the meagre housekeeping,
and many things she liked not, on little more than
nothing a week. It was strenuous work, but she carried
it out cheerfully and unostentatiously, and contrived to
provide enough to keep his mind from being worried
with sordid considerations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes—not so often as she wished—he read what
he had written, and they talked over the human considerations
that go to make a play. He himself was
most enthusiastic about the work, and to a great extent
she shared his belief. There was, however, a certain
chilliness in his lines and expressed thoughts, which by
the gentlest tact she strove to warm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a delicate enough operation in all conscience,
for there is no machinery more difficult to guide than
an artist’s mind, and none that demands overhaul more
constantly. Hers was the task of tightening the bolts
of a moving vehicle—one attended with grave risks
to the mechanic. She took her satisfaction after the
manner of a mechanic, by noting the smoother running
and more even purr of the machine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they had determined upon their wedding day,
the physical, and even the spiritual, side of their union
was in abeyance. Of sweet intimacies and gentle understandings
there were none. It was the work first, the
work last, and the work which took precedence to all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Eve it was a lonely life—a life of unceasing
mental and manual exercise. She strove with head and
hand that his spirit might talk with posterity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes there were knocks, but she took them
bravely, looking always to the future to repay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning in the early summer Wynne fretfully
threw down his pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whitey-gold sunshine was calling of bluebell
woods and cloud shadows racing over the downs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must get out,” he said—“out in the fields somewhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve filled her lungs expectantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let’s go to Richmond,” she said. “Do you remember
the first night I came back, and we said we’d go
there one day and eat apple turnovers on the way
home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, oh yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’ud be gorgeous to have some fresh air, and we
could make plans and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but not today. I want to think today—I
should be better alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was foolish to be hurt, and gently she answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t stop you thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some other day, then. This morning I’ll go alone.
That last act is bothering me. I shall bring back a
fierce hunger for you to appease.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all. He reached for his hat and walked
to the door. As he laid his hand on the knob she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think of me bending over the gas-ring, Wynne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned and looked queerly at her without replying.
The angle of her speech was new and unexpected.
Then his cleverness suggested:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall think of you as you’ll look when our honeymoon
begins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant she was disarmed and had stretched
out a friendly hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to be level with the future for one day,”
she said. “Out in the fields we are as rich as we shall
ever be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The leaves would be no greener if all fame were
ours,” he answered; and added, “but they’d seem
greener. Come, if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’ll stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave his hand a small pressure. He looked down
on it as it lay in his palm. There was dirt upon her
fingers from the scouring of pots and pans. As he
noted this he laughed shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must employ a Court manicurist when our Day
dawns,” he said. “I could not worship a queen whose
hands were soiled. Expect me about six.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Who can pretend to fathom the deeps of a woman’s
mind. Long after he had gone, Eve stood looking at
her hands with solemn, frightened eyes.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The manner of Wynne Rendall’s coming into prominence
was fortuitous. It happened a little over two years
after his marriage, and, broadly speaking, was engineered
by Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a result of some unexpected sales to American
publishers a few extra pounds slipped through the lodging
letter-box, and Eve insisted he should spend some
of these in joining a club of good standing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve been in the dark too long, Wynne. A writer
of plays must be known by the people who produce them,
by the better actors and critics. They must get used
to seeing you before they will believe in you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised no opposition to the idea. Of late he had
felt cabined and confined, and the thought of broader
horizons appealed to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uncle Clem would put you up for the Phœnician,
wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne shook his head irritably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not disposed to ask favours of Uncle Clem,”
he replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was evident enough he disapproved of my mode
of life when last we met. It will be time to ask him
to do things for me when he approves. Besides, there’s
no need. A cousin of my mother’s is a member—I’ll
ask him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he approve of your mode of life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably not; but, since I have no interest in him
one way or the other, it doesn’t matter. The man is
rich and a fool.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know you had a rich cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t a thing to boast about. I rather believe I
have a moderately rich father and mother somewhere—still
it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” said Eve, “you have never mentioned
them before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what persuaded me to do so at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to tell. They wanted me to accept a sound
commercial position—whatever that may mean; in declining
to do so I forfeited my birthright, and sacrificed
my immortal soul to the flames.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you run away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I walked away. They were too slow to render running
a necessity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are rather callous,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely to God you don’t expect me to take off my
hat, like a music-hall serio, when I speak of Home and
Mother.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, that would be rather silly—still⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One must judge the value of things and persons
on two counts—their service and their effect. If their
service is negligible, and they produce no effect, it is
clearly useless to have any further dealings with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like that,” said Eve. “It’s a cold philosophy.
You sponge the wine from the cellars and complain
when the vats are empty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t complain—I pass on. One must, or die of
thirst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a false thirst.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That doesn’t matter so long as one feels it acutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She generally allowed him the luxury of supplying
the phrase to round off an argument. It is a tribute
to the gallantry of women that they will allow the
vanquished to feel he is the victor, and as true of the
best of them as the popular belief to the contrary is
false.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne joined the Phœnician, and after a while came
to spend much of his time there. It made, he said, a
change from the never-ending sameness of their penny-threefarthing
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so long since he had foregathered with fellow-men
that at first he spent his club hours in shy silence.
He would sit, ostensibly reading a periodical, and actually
listening to the conversation of those about him.
In so doing he learnt many things in regard to the
subjects which men will discuss one with another. The
Phœnician was to a great extent a rabble club. The
members were composed of professional men—artists,
writers, actors, and those curious individuals who form
a tail-light to the arts, being bracketed on as a kind
of chorus. These latter always appeared to be well provided
with money and ill provided with brains. They
knew the names of many stage people, and reeled them
off one after another as a parrot delivers its limited
vocabulary. Seemingly they derived much pleasure
from the practice, and their happiest conversational circumstance
was to mention some one whose name they had
never introduced before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne made unto himself an enemy of this section
of the rabble by a chance remark on an occasion when
he happened to be in their midst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose,” he said, “you collect names as more
intellectual folk collect cigar bands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As invariably was the case he was rather pleased
with himself for producing this remark. It suggested
a line of thought, and shortly afterwards he produced
an article entitled “Men and their Talk.” The article,
which boasted a lemon wit, appeared in the <span class='it'>Monday
Review</span>, and offended many people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The average man,” he wrote, “has but four topics
of conversation which he considers worthy of discussion.
1. His relation to other men’s wives. 2. His
prowess at sport. 3. The names of restaurants at which
he would have us believe he dines. 4. His capacity
for consuming liquor. Of these subjects Nos. 1 and 4
are usually taken in conjunction. Thus, before we are
privileged to hear the more intimate passages of his
amours, we are obliged to follow the assuaging of his
thirst from double cocktail to treble liqueur. A nice
balance in self-satisfaction is proved by a man’s pride
in what he drinks and how he loves.” Then, in another
paragraph: “The average man is not proud of resisting
the temptations of the flesh, but is always proud of
yielding to them. Whenever men are gathered together
you will hear them speak in admiration of what our
moral code forbids, but you will not hear them boast of
their fidelity. Many a faithful husband lies of infidelity
that he may stand even with his fellows.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of all the criticisms provoked by this article Wynne
was best pleased by one from a brother member, who
announced that it was “an infernal breach of confidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The club made serious inroads on Wynne’s finances,
for no matter how abstemious a man may be, he cannot
rub shoulders with his own kind without a certain
amount of wear on his pocket linings. In consequence,
Eve was obliged to cut things very fine and forego every
atom of personal expenditure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possibly because he had had such small dealings with
money, Wynne was not a generous giver. In these
days he disbursed less toward the household account
than ever before, but did not expect less to appear upon
the table on this account. Neither did he expect Eve to
appear before him in dresses which had lost all pretentions
to attractiveness. Sometimes he would remark:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When on earth are you going to throw away that
dreadful old garment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artistic mind is apt to be unreasonable in its demands—a
circumstance which Eve was obliged to keep
very much before her eyes if she would stay the tear
which sought to rise there.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was some months before the club yielded a practical
return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was seated in the hollow of a deep leather
chair, and he overheard two men talking. One was
Max Levis, London’s newest impresario, and the other
Leonard Passmore, a producer of some standing, whose
methods Wynne disapproved of very heartily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve read the play?” queried Levis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I should say it was a certainty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you would—that’s capital! Wanted your
opinion before writing to Quiltan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne knew Quiltan by reputation. His Oxford
verses had caused a stir, and the rare appearances of
his articles were hailed enthusiastically by press and
public alike. Lane Quiltan besides being gifted, was
exceedingly well off—a reason, perhaps, for his small
literary output.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Max Levis played with the pages of a manuscript
copy of the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Formed any views regarding the production?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Passmore had formed many views, and proceeded
to expound them at some length. He held forth for the
best part of half an hour, while Wynne, from the screen
of his chair, silently scorned every word he uttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” he thought, “and these are the men who
cater art to the nation!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the two men rose and walked toward the
dining-room, heavy in talk. On the small table beside
where they had sat lay the copy of the play. As the
swing doors closed behind them Wynne picked it up and
started to read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Messrs. Levis and Passmore stayed long at their meat,
and Wynne had read the play from cover to cover before
they returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not often his heart went out to a contemporary’s
work, but this was an exception. What he read filled
him with delight, envy, and admiration. “Witches”—for
so the play was called—possessed the rarest quality.
There was wit, imagination, and satire, and it was
written with that effortless ease at which all true artists
should aim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he laid the copy back on the small table Wynne
gave vent to an exclamation of indignant resentment,
provoked by memories of the proposals Passmore had
made in regard to the manner in which he proposed
to interpret the work. Here was a thing of real artistic
beauty, which was to be subjected to commercial mutilation
by a cross-grained fool who had made a reputation
by massing crowds in such positions that the centre of
the stage was clear for the principals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His feelings toward Mr. Passmore were not improved
when that gentleman and Mr. Levis reoccupied their
former chairs, and, warmed by wine, started to discuss
their mutual follies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With silent irritation Wynne rose and left the club.
He arrived home about nine o’clock, where he inveighed
against managers and producers, and the dunces who
dance in high places. In the course of the tirade he
explained the cause of his anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a real thing—and it’s good and right, and
cram-jam full of exquisite possibilities. Those idiots
haven’t begun to understand it—are blind to its
beauty—haven’t a notion how good it is. In God’s
name, why don’t they let me produce the thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eve had an inspiration which sent Wynne forth
into the night, and found him, twenty minutes later,
ringing the bell of a house in Clarges Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking into consideration the clothes he wore, and
his general look of dilapidation, his attitude when the
door was opened by an important footman was praiseworthy
and remarkable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He simply said “Thank you,” and stepped into the
hall. Then he removed his hat and gave it to the
man, saying, “Mr. Wynne Rendall.” The bluff resulted
in his being ushered into a drawing-room, in
which were a number of ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always easy to recognize one’s host in a mixed
gathering, provided he does not know you,” commented
Wynne, as the door closed, “for he is the person whose
face betrays the greatest perplexity. How do you do,
Mr. Quiltan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lane Quiltan shook hands doubtfully, but not without
interest. Out of politeness he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seem to know your name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s unlikely,” replied Wynne, “for I have been
at some pains to keep it in the background. One of
these days, however, you will know it very much better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you come here to tell me so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether, although in a sense it is mixed up
with my visit. To be frank, I came in the hope of
finding you alone. Still, I suppose later on you will be.”
He smiled engagingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan scarcely knew whether to be annoyed or
amused. In deference to his guests, he chose the latter
alternative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to be an unconventional man, Mr. Rendall,”
he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, I had not looked for a compliment so soon;
but perhaps you use the term correctively?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just possible, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet my conduct is nothing like so unconventional
as the central character in ‘Witches’ ”—a remark
which startled from Lane Quiltan: “What on
earth do you know about ‘Witches’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne smiled agreeably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have relations of my own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doubtless, but I <span class='it'>would</span> like an answer to my question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not get it, for Wynne only repeated the smile,
with a shade more satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear,” he said, “our conversation is proving very
tiresome to your friends. Shall we talk in another
room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extraordinary creature!” gasped a very splendid
lady seated at the grand piano.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is what every one will be saying shortly,” returned
Wynne, and won a laugh for the readiness of his
wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose, Lane,” assumed a man who was airing
the tails of his dress-coat before the fire—“I suppose we
ought to take the hint and depart, but your friend is so
devilish amusing I vote in favour of remaining.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir,” said Wynne, with very great solemnity, “if
I vow to be devilish dull, will you in return vote in
favour of going?” The laugh came his way again; and
he proceeded, “I make the suggestion with the most
generous motives, for if you remain with your coat-tails
so perilously near the flame we shall be constrained to
the inevitable necessity of putting you out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A youngish man, who was sitting in a corner, rose
and shook the creases from his trousers and glanced at
the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I at least have to go,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t hurry away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne touched Quiltan on the arm. “Never stay a
pioneer,” he implored. “ ‘For the rest shall follow
after by the bones upon the way,’ to quote Kipling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes after his arrival he had cleared the room
completely. The guests departed without apparent resentment:
indeed, one lady gave Wynne her card, and
said, “You positively must come and be amusing at one
of my Thursdays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan was wearing an expression of some annoyance
when he returned after bidding farewell to the last
of the company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is all very well,” he said; “but what precisely
do you want?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before answering Wynne took an easy inspection
of the man before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lane Quiltan was tall, well built, and very pleasant
to look upon. His features were attractive and regular,
his voice and expression were compelling of confidence.
At a glance Wynne summed him up as a “good fellow,
and a good deal more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Quiltan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Primarily I have succeeded in doing what I wanted,
and that was to convince you that I am no ordinary
man. Secondly, I want to produce your play, ‘Witches,’
and if you will ask me to sit down for a minute I shall
prove beyond argument why I am the only person who
can do it justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lane Quiltan gestured Wynne to a chair, and seated
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire away!” he said; “but I am afraid your
chances are small. The play is already in the hands of
Max Levis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem pretty well acquainted with my affairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary, I know nothing about them.
I knew Levis had the play, because I borrowed his
copy without permission while the fellow was feeding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you generally do things like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have no general practices. I act as the inclination
suggests. In this case it is fortunate for both of
us that I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For both of us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly, for I <span class='it'>mean</span> to produce ‘Witches.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least you are persistent,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am, and you are not. You take things too easily,
because you’ve all this”—he made an embracing gesture.
“You are too sure, Mr. Quiltan, I know. You write
this play and direct it to Max Levis, and then, because
fame and money are merely accessories in your life,
you take no further interest in the matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you arrive at that conclusion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Simply enough. Why did you send the play to
Levis? Do you admire his work so inordinately?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know very little about him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. Would you hand over a best child to be
taught by some one who might be an idiot for all you
knew? Two years ago Max Levis was a diamond buyer—what
the devil should he know about plays?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He engages competent people to produce them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And takes forty per cent. for doing so. Do you
consider he is more qualified to engage competent people
than you are?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have never thought about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then think about it now. Don’t spoil a fine work
through artistic slackness and drift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like your enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d like my production better. Now, look here,
I overheard Levis talking to Leonard Passmore about
your play tonight. These are some of Passmore’s ideas.
Tell me if you like ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Word for word he repeated the conversation of a
couple of hours before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were those your intentions, Mr. Quiltan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not exactly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What were?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a producer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course you are not. You’re an author, and an
author never knows where the good or bad in his own
work lies. Your work is shining good—if the good
can be brought out,—and you’d entrust it, without a
thought, to a couple of merchants, with no more artistry
or selection between ’em than a provincial auctioneer.
Let me produce the play, and I’ll give you this⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something dazzling in the sparkle of
thoughts Wynne gave voice to as he discussed the possibilities
of the play. He seemed to have grasped its
living essence, and to have impregnated it with a spirit
of higher worth than even the author had believed possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you could do that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can always do as I feel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan rose and paced the room excitedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe in you,” he said. “I favour this co-operation.
But what’d Levis say? He’d stick out for his
own man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good heavens! What do you want with Levis?
Back the venture yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows you’ve money enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know nothing about theatres.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know plenty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan paused and bit his forefinger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Take a theatre and do it ourselves?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the Lord, why not indeed! It ’ud be tremendous
fun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It ’ud be tremendous earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Either way, I’m game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Settled, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s settled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne stood himself a cab from Clarges Street at
three o’clock in the morning. He looked ten years
younger as he burst into the room where Eve was waiting
up for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve done it!” he cried. “I’ve done it! I’m on
the road upward at last.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was extraordinarily full of himself in the
days which followed. Day and night he worked with
feverish energy on schemes for the play. He went out
and came in at all hours. In his excitement he entirely
ignored Eve’s presence, except when he appealed to her
on some delicate point dealing with the attitude of the
women characters. Having secured what he wanted he
would wave aside further discussion and plunge afresh
into his thought-packed aloneness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once he jerked out the information that he was to
receive a hundred pounds for the production and ten
per cent. profits during the run of the piece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve engaged the cast and we shall arrange about
the theatre in a day or two. Here, read that speech
aloud—I want to hear what it sounds like in a woman’s
voice. Yes, that’s it. Thanks! That’s all I want to
know. You read it quite right. I believe you could
have acted! Is there something to eat ready? I’m
going out in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It won’t be long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick as you can, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she laid the cloth, Eve ventured to say: “Don’t
you think we might have a maid to do the grubby work?
It would give me more time to help you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He seemed absorbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, all right. Some day. You do everything I
want, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that lunch ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some clothes arrived for him a few days later, and
for the first time Eve saw her husband well clad. The
build of them gave an added manliness to his slender
figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The business of taking a theatre being successfully accomplished,
Wynne assumed instantly the guise of a
commander-in-chief. He spoke with an air of finality
on all subjects, and wrapped himself in a kind of remoteness
not infrequently to be observed in actor-managers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Oddly enough, his new importance possessed Eve with
a desire to laugh and ruffle his hair. Had he taken himself
less seriously she would have done so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once she asked if he would not like to give her a part
in the play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heavens alive!” he said, “I’m pestered the day
long with people who want engagements. Spare me
from it at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was hardly a graceful speech, but it demonstrated
his frame of mind with some accuracy. Perhaps he
realized the remark was churlish, for he followed it with
another:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Besides, you’ll have plenty to do. We’re going to
get out of this. I took a flat this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Without saying a word to me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said all that was needed to the agent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yet you might have mentioned it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was busy. After all, it only requires one person to
take a flat. There, that’s the address. Fix up moving
in as soon as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve picked up the slip of paper he had dropped into
her lap. Despite her disappointment she felt a thrill
of excitement at the news:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many rooms are there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, four or five—a bedroom for each of us—I forget
the number. Have a look at it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall want carpets and some more furniture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but that can wait—can’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Take away the joy of planning from a woman and
you rob the safe of half its treasure.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There was no room in Wynne’s mind for further
discussion. It was fully occupied with his great advertisement
scheme, which, in a few days’ time, would
fling his name upon every newspaper and hoarding in
the metropolis. He had no intention of allowing his
share in the production to lack prominence. The name
Wynne Rendall was to take precedence of all other consideration
in his campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The public is to take this play through me,” he
announced, “and me they shall have in large doses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve visited the flat alone, and made what arrangements
were needful for moving their few belongings.
It was a sunny little flat, and with adequate appointments
would have looked very charming. The small
amount of furniture they possessed, however, seemed
painfully inadequate spread over the various rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the day of the move she worked like a galley-slave
to put the place in agreeable order. She felt
somehow that it was a great occasion, and that when
Wynne returned from the theatre he would feel likewise.
Together, perhaps, they would have a glorious
talk about their nearing future, and a little house-warming
of two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she was disappointed, for Wynne made no comment
when he came in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My posters are out,” he cried. “Have you seen
’em?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t had a chance. I’ve been busy here all day
getting straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked tired and rather grubby—her hair was
tumbled, and her hands patched with floor-stain. For
some reason her untidiness irritated Wynne. The girls
at the theatre were smart and fresh, and their clothes
were pleasant to see. A man expects his wife to be
always at her best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um!” he remarked. “You look in rather a pickle.”
His eyes wandered round the room: “Seems very bare,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed bare to her, too, but she would have taken
it kindly if he had not said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With some curtains it would be better—and a few
more chairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Still, it’s the address that matters at the
moment. The rest can wait till we see how the play
goes. Just now I need all the money I can get for
my own pocket. It’s essential. It’s bare and uncomfortable;
but I have the club, so it doesn’t really
matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t a club,” flashed Eve, and repented the
words almost before she had spoken them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne looked at her fixedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord!” he exclaimed, “we are not going to start
that sort of thing, are we?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the quality of his voice struck her with
startling force. It was so much more a “married” tone
than she remembered to have heard before. The
petulant child note had disappeared, and with its disappearance
the mother note in her own voice wrapped itself
up in sudden hardness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She held his eyes with hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I bargained for a share,” she said. “Am I getting
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wilted, and his head tossed from side to side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is all this about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I getting my share?” repeated Eve, more
kindly. “You know if I am. Answer ‘Yes,’ if you
honestly think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tired,” he countered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not too tired to say ‘Yes.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, very well! If you want furniture and things,
buy them. I rather thought you could see deeper than
that. Still, if you⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop! Don’t say any more—please don’t.” She
pressed her hand quickly and nervously to her lips; then,
with a half-laugh, “Oh, how silly I am; but you frightened
me. You—you were laughing, Wynne, when you
said that—weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her perplexed, and saw she was in deadly
earnest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” he answered. “I was laughing—’course
I was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to tell the truth, Wynne Rendall, Master of Psychology,
was sorely out of his depth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right,” said Eve, and crossed to the little
fireplace, where she stood awhile thinking. “I’ll fetch
your dinner now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid the cloth and placed the dishes upon it.
There was an awkwardness between them as they took
their places, and very little disposition to talk.
Wynne’s thoughts were mixed with wondering at her
attitude and with intentions for the play. Hers were
back to the birthday party of nearly three years before.
It had been a night so full of promise. Everything
had seemed so likely then. Then it had seemed
good that the love and sunshine for which her spirit
prayed should be rendered on the deferred payment
system. Was it possible those goods would be outworn
before the debt was discharged? She shivered and
looked up under her lids at Wynne. He had changed
so much; he seemed bigger—more like a man! The frail
boy body and restless spirit were no longer upon the
surface. He looked to have more ballast—to stand more
firmly as a man among men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice broke in upon her thoughts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re extraordinarily mine, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she nodded, and after a pause, “are you
glad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not give a direct answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should know. Look! small wife, this is a between-while
with us, and I want you to sympathize with
the position. I’m all out to win—and I shall win—but
I haven’t won yet. Until I do it isn’t possible for
us to stand side by side. There’s barely enough to keep
one afloat, and that one must be myself. You admit
that, don’t you? I’m meeting all sorts of alleged big-wigs,
and I must meet ’em level. As things are it is
only just possible to do so. To raise the scale at one
side, t’other must be kept down. But it won’t be for
long, and afterwards it will be you and I—understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep on helping, then, all you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so the best of us fulfil our obligations and justify
our consciences.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Eve sat by herself in the second row of the stalls.
Her eyes were glorious with hope. On her lap lay the
program of the piece, with Wynne’s name ringing from
the page.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The printing was a stupendous piece of self-sufficiency.
She had noted, half-fearful, half-amused, the hum of
conversation which had gone round the theatre as the
audience noted the persistent large-type booming of a
single unknown personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This young man is taking responsibilities upon his
shoulders,” observed one newspaper critic to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other smiled sardonically. Already he was tasting
in anticipation several phrases he proposed to level
against Mr. Wynne Rendall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who is he anyway?” seemed to arise from the
general buzz of voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From where she sat Eve could see the profile of Lane
Quiltan. His box seemed very full—a circumstance
which made her glad, for Wynne had refused to offer
her a seat there. “He won’t want to be bothered with
introductions on a first night; besides, there are lots of
people who must be invited. I want you to be in the
body of the house and feel the pulse of the audience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So it came about she was alone with none to talk
with, and none to admire the pretty frock she wore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had not occurred to Wynne she would want a dress
for his first night—she had not expected that it would;
but, nevertheless, she was beautifully clad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The possession of the evening dress and a wrap
marked her first deliberate step toward rebellion. She
had ordered it from a first-class West End dress-maker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send the bill to Mr. Wynne Rendall at the Vandyke
Theatre,” she had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before had Eve possessed so sweet a frock, and
the touch of it sent a pleasurable thrill through her body.
When she had finished dressing, every vestige of the
drab, houseworking little figure had been transformed
into a simple expression of fragile and delicious womanhood.
Very gloriously she had felt this to be so as she
stood before the mirror waiting for Wynne to return
and take her to the theatre.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not return. A messenger boy came instead,
with a scribbled note asking for his “dress things,
as I shan’t have time to get back before the play begins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus Eve was denied even a moment to wish him well,
and took her stall unnoticed and alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she looked at Lane Quiltan’s profile she wondered
how he felt at being forced to take a second place to
Wynne in every point of prominence. For some reason
she conceived that he would not be troubled over-much.
There was a repose and stability in his looks which suggested
a mental balance not easily disturbed by small-weight
issues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At long range she liked and felt the wish to know
him better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Steadfast, substantial,” she reasoned; “very unlike
Wynne. He is hoping for the success of the play, not
of himself. He won’t mind sacrificing himself to get
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came to her that both she and Quiltan were contributing
their share toward the making of Wynne
Rendall, and both she and Quiltan were being left a little
behind in the doing of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curtain rose, and half an hour later Eve knew
that Wynne had made good all he boasted he would do—and
more. The spirit of the play shone through the
lines with a truth of definition that was truly remarkable.
The values of the human emotions portrayed were
perfect. It was an example of the purest artistry and
the surest perception. Not an idea was blurred—not an
inflection out of place. Through an infinity of natural
detail, rendered with mirrored exactitude, ran the soul
and intention of the play, like the dominant theme of a
great orchestral fugue. Even the veriest tyro in matters
dramatic realized that no mere assembly of actors and
actresses, however brilliant, could have achieved so faultless
an effect without a master hand to guide them.
What Wynne had learnt in the Paris ateliers years before
he had set upon the stage. The words of the old
Maitre had soaked in: “To we artists the human figure
exists in masses of light and shade. It is not made up of
legs and hands, and breasts, and ears and teeth. No,
by the good God, no!” Wynne had remembered, and
here was the distillation of the words. Here was his
canvas with its faithful <span class='it'>chiaroscuro</span> of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of all the people in the house that night only
Eve knew the palette whereon the colours had been
mixed. One by one she recognized and silently named
them, and sometimes she glowed with pride, for many
owed their brilliance and their being to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well done, Wynne! Oh, well done!” she breathed,
as the curtain fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are seeing things tonight,” said an important
critic as he and a contemporary passed toward the foyer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve rose and followed them, and during the interval
she moved from group to group and listened to what the
audience had to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt Wynne Rendall had come into
his own, for although every one praised the play it was
his name which came first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall let him off a scathing over the press campaign,”
said a representative of one of London’s dailies.
“It’s the best production I’ve seen in years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve noticed and recognized from Wynne’s descriptions,
some of the tail-lights to the arts. They were busy
adding his name to their lists. They were boasting of
alleged friendship with him. One of the more venturesome
spoke of him familiarly as “old W. R.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man who leaps from obscurity to initials in a single
night is getting a move on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the final curtain there was an ovation. The author
and Wynne responded to “author’s call” together, then,
as the applause continued, Wynne came down to the
footlights alone. He seemed very collected, and twisted
an unlighted cigarette between his forefinger and thumb.
For the first time Eve thought he looked young—young
and care-free, as though he had stepped into the element
he had searched for for so many years. In this new
element he moved with an ease and assurance that surprised
her. She had thought he would show feverishness
or excitement, but there was no trace of either in his
bearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Speech! speech!” shouted the gallery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked up at them with a winning smile, and replied,
“Of course.” There was a fresh burst of applause
and a wave of laughter, and when it died away
he began to speak in the manner of a man chatting with
friends about a fireside:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a charming play, isn’t it? Very charming.
Tomorrow my learned critics will be saying so. They
will say, perhaps, ‘The play’s the thing’; but I trust
they won’t forget that the manner of its interpretation
is possibly an even greater thing.” He stopped, smiled
and said, half under his breath, “Render unto Cæsar—Good-night,
everybody.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve waited in the foyer, her cheeks aglow with excitement.
Presently she saw Wynne come through an
iron door into the press of congratulation. Half the
important stage people in London were thronging round
him. His composure was remarkable. Under the influence
of success he seemed to have grown up and moved
as a man among men. A pretty, rather elaborate girl
pressed forward to greet him with adulation, and Eve
noted how he touched her cheek with a kind of possessive
patronage, and turned aside to speak to some one else.
The action was very unlike her preconception of his
character. Presently he noticed her, and nodded a smile
across the crowded room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Like it?” his lips framed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And her eyes flashed back the answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seemingly this satisfied him, for he moved away. A
little later on he noticed her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t wait for me,” he said. “I’m sure to be late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve walked out of the theatre alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get me a cab,” she said to the commissionaire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, madam, but there are very few tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That one,” she pointed to a taxi standing by the
curb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is being kept for Mr. Rendall, madam.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, is it?” said Eve, and walked toward the Tube.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>XI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As she turned into Jermyn Street a middle-aged man,
walking briskly in the same direction, came level with
her. He was in evening dress, and his coat was open
to the night air. He wore a soft hat, and a pipe projected
from his mouth at a jaunty angle. As he walked
he sang to himself as one who is glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve caught a glimpse of his features, and gave a little
exclamation, whereupon the man turned and looked at
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo!” he said, “I know you—but—good heavens!
I’ve got you. But what in blazes are you doing here by
yourself, tonight of all nights?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m walking home, Uncle Clementine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, begad! it’s meself will walk with you. Always
talk Irish when I’m excited—at least I believe I do;
but what’s it matter? I’m excited enough to talk double
Dutch tonight—aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather,” responded Eve, for Uncle Clem awoke an
echo of his mood in others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should think you were. Splendid! Top-hole!
Lord! Lord! Lord! What a production! Aren’t
you proud?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s away, that young fellar of yours—he’s up and
away. Always knew he had the stuff, from the day
when I ran off with him in a station fly and talked
fairies under the trees. He’s learnt—knew he would,
and he has. Oh! he’s learnt well! Wouldn’t mind laying
a fiver he’s taken a share of his knowledge from
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s nice of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not a bit—common sense! Tell you what, though—’tween
us two—that speech was a mistake. Cheap and
nasty! Drop him a hint, there’s a clever girl, to cut all
that stuff right out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve smiled. “Have you ever tried to drop Wynne
hints about things like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve thrown him a slab of wisdom from time to time.
Not that kind, perhaps. But that’s what I say—<span class='it'>you</span> tell
him. You’ve the opportunity. Ha!” He threw up his
head. “That’s one of the good things in life that I’ve
missed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To have some one who, in the night, will touch
my foot with her littlest toe and breathe over the pillow
all the naughty mistakes I’ve made during the
day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in her tone discouraged him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course that mayn’t be the way it’s done; I’ve no
experience, but I’ve fondly imagined it was so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So have I,” said Eve; “but, like yourself, I have
no experience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What d’you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I stretched out my littlest toe I should bump it
against the partition wall. That would be very sad,
wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem stopped short.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you remember our wedding talk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to walk very fast, so fast that she could
scarcely keep pace with him. At last he jerked out the
question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That travesty holds good, then? That’s why, on
the night of his success, you’re walking home alone
’stead of feasting at a top-notch restaurant. Good God!
And I’ve been shaking hands with myself these four
hours past that my gloomy forebodings hadn’t come true—but,
damn it! they have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” exclaimed Eve, “you mustn’t say that; it isn’t
so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The success was to come first. You remember
we said so that day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what’s wrong with tonight’s success?—and
you’re walking home alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, tonight he has found himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And left you behind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to say that. I beg you not to say things
like that. They hurt so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant he was all sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, my dear, don’t heed me. You understand
the boy, and I’m only an onlooker who gets a
glimpse here and there. That’s how it seemed to
me at a snapshot glance—but I may be wrong. I
don’t know what I’m talking about half the time.
I love that husband of yours, he has such a splendid
pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, he’s been so splendid, Uncle Clem—you must
believe that. Never for an instant has he spared himself.
He’s worked—worked—worked. That’s why he
came out so finely tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. But though a man does not spare himself
he must always spare others—that’s the great science
of life. Haven’t you worked too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been partners, as we said we’d be until success
was ours. And now he’s made the success, and⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Success as an artist, and he’s going to share it as
a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe so—oh, I do believe so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem walked awhile in silence. When he began
to talk it was almost as if he were speaking to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queer trusting folk, we mortals,” he said. “And
we set ourselves such wonderful tasks. How old Dame
Nature must laugh at us and all our philosophies.
Fancy two young people locking up the spark of love
which had sprung between them, packing it away in a
secret safe, and believing it could be brought to life when
convenience allowed. How old Dame Nature must
laugh! Can’t you imagine her peeping into the safe to
see how the spark is getting along?” He turned suddenly
upon Eve. “How is it getting along?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I keep it locked up here.” She pressed her hand
upon her heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful you!” said Uncle Clem. “God bless
your trust. Hullo! This where you live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I come up for awhile?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no. Of course not. He’ll come back with
his pockets full of champagne, and his heart come to
life. I like you, you know. I think you’re fine.
You’re so damn good to look at, too. Ever hear of the
purple patch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just thinking you’ve the leading light in your eyes
that should guide a man there. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night, Uncle Clem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At two o’clock Eve took off her pretty frock, put on
her plain cotton nightdress, and went to bed.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span><h1>PART SEVEN<br/> <span class='sub-head'>—WHO TRAVELS ALONE”</span></h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>In the weeks following it was made clearly evident
that Wynne Rendall was taking no precautions that
his wife should share his new prosperity. Conceivably
he thought that the mere sharing of his name—a
name which had sprung into such instant prominence—was
adequate compensation for any woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The newspapers had given him unsparing praise, and
already he had been approached by several managements
with a view to undertaking their productions. To these
offers he shook his head, replying that he was a writer
by profession and not a producer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an interview he told the reporter that he only
worked in the direction of his ambitions, and for the
moment his ambitions were satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was, of course, mere persiflage, but several members
of the reading public thought it very fine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was asked everywhere—but only accepted invitations
which appealed to him. At the functions he attended
he usually contrived to fire off at least a couple
of startling phrases which were remembered and repeated
by those persons who unintentionally work inside
advertising for the would-be great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being out and about so much he did not bother to
alter the conditions of life at home. It is true he left
rather more money for Eve to use, but since he showed
no disposition for her to take a place beside him on the
new plane she found no incentive to change the old
régime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the morning after the play was produced, with
all the notices before her, Eve had stretched out a hand
to him, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve won—absolutely you’ve won. My dear, I am
so proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I’ve made a start. There’s a long way to go
yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a chilly sense she felt that he had not said this
from any modesty, but rather to delay admitting the
success for which they had fought their battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was conscious afterwards that he shunned the
topic of his success, and kept the conversation on impersonal
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That glorious moment to which all her hopes had been
pinned and all her labours consecrated did not mature
into reality. It seemed that he was floating out of her
life as a steamship passes a yacht at sea. And so, with
the measure of his success, there came about in Eve a
corresponding stagnation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It would have been easy then to have engaged a servant
to do the housework, to have bought furniture, linen,
and the many delightful things she had planned to do;
but somehow the inclination to do so had gone. It was
preferable to have occupation of some sort, if only to
keep her thoughts from brooding on these disappointments.
Besides, she took an almost cynical interest in
wondering how long he would allow her to remain as a
drudge who worked for him with her two hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne himself was cheerfully indifferent to the trend
of her thoughts. He was in excellent spirits, enthusiastic
for the present, and full of plans for the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When “Witches” came to an end he said he proposed
to put on a play of his own. Lane Quiltan would
supply the capital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you asked him?” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t it be better to do so before being too
sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed the idea aside with:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some things one can take for granted. I am as confident
of his support as I am confident that at least five
young ladies in the company are wondering when I shall
invite them to Brighton for the week-end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With rather an effort, Eve replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only five?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said in the company,” he very rapturously retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The suggestion of these words struck a peculiar chord
of memory in Eve. They recalled very vividly a vulgar
little cousin of hers—a boy scarcely out of his teens—who
had boasted, with considerable pride, of a liaison
with a young lady at a tobacconist’s. It was an unpleasant
parallel, but she could not clear it from her
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitherto the physical side of Wynne had been so dormant.
She had nursed the shell which held his spirit,
and nourished it to a manlier form. As he stood there
before speaking she realized that in body he was a man
of different fibre, capable of passions not only of the
mind. It would be tragic and pitiable if these were to
be awakened by the same vulgar instincts which attack
the little Lotharios of nineteen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the man who had starved for a week to buy
a copy of Walter Pater.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell to wondering whether, had their first meeting
been now instead of then, she could have sat the night
through in his rooms without fear of consequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And while she wondered upon these matters, Wynne’s
eyes travelled critically over her face and figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re rather drab,” he thought; “you haven’t much
colour. If your hair were dressed differently it would
be an improvement, perhaps. That is certainly a deplorable
dress—and your hands!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man whose function is to produce plays acquires
a ready knack of judging possible qualities by external
indications. The habit is not one to be recommended in
the home, for in practising it he is apt to overlook many
essentials and ignore grave liabilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A just man would not accuse a sweep of possessing a
blackened soul because his face was sooted from sweeping
the flues. The instance may sound trivial enough,
but it is no less trivial than the train of thought running
through Wynne’s lightly-poised mind as he contemplated
the wife of his own making. His eyes were
deceived by petty superficiality, and blinded to the
beauty veiled behind a screen of three years’ unremitting
toil. He did not bother to speculate if that beauty
would leap to glorious life at the touch of the hand that
swept the screen away. To follow his thoughts to their
inglorious anchorage, he was sensible to a wave of self-pity.
It seemed rather ill-luck, with the ball of success
at his feet, a fresh glow of manhood ripening in his veins,
that he should be tied to a woman who had lost the fine
edge of her desirability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see,” said Eve at last; “and do you propose to
disappoint them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne dropped his cigarette into the grate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never know what I propose to do. The greatest
mistake in the world is to cut the picnic sandwiches before
knowing what the weather will be.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It was more to please his humour than from any liking
for the lesser grades of courtship that Wynne came to
amuse himself at the theatre by talking perilous rubbish
to a highly unimportant young lady of the cast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before had he indulged in this particular sport,
and never, until lately, had the temptation to do so
allured him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To tell the truth, he was not a little flattered by the
success of his early attempts at love badinage; although,
had he chosen to look beneath the surfaces of the very
shallow waters which were ruffled by his wit, he would
have found little cause for self-congratulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme Waybury, the favoured, had an ax to grind.
In her trivial soul was ambition to get on (“getting
on” implying the receipt of a salary large enough to
satisfy her tastes in shoe-leather and millinery). A little
moral laxity is sometimes a short road to the realizations
of these trifles. Favours, artfully bestowed in the right
quarter, are often more fruitful of success than is
genuine talent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her, Wynne Rendall was a power in the land—a
power which, with a little tact, might easily be diverted
toward herself. Without being affected by prickings of
conscience, she decided, if occasion offered, she would
compromise herself with him, and step lightly from the
wreckage of her virtue to spheres of extravagance hitherto
unattainable. To the furtherance of this ignoble
end, she pouted, smiled, and performed those various
verbal and facial evolutions which, for a hundred centuries,
have served to divert mankind from the straight
and narrow path.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme was one of those pouting darlings who look
infinitely sad at the smallest word, with that quality of
sadness which provokes thoughts of remedial kisses in the
male mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve produced her first pout at an understudy rehearsal
taken by Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know,” he had said, “you are very bad in this
part.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme then pouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, aren’t you?” continued Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme added four quick blinks to the pout very
adroitly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was all, but when Wynne passed through the
stage door Esme and her pout were there—a vision to
disturb dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne smiled as he walked up the street. It was
pleasant to reflect that by half a dozen words he could
cause a pout to be produced of so enduring a nature.
As an observer, he considered the elements which go to
make a good pout. Undoubtedly Esme’s pout had been
a good one. Her lips were of a sweet red, and moist
with the dews of grief. With a good pout one saw ever
such a little more of lips than one was accustomed to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man can think long of this subject without considering
the possibilities thereof, and for the first time
Wynne was consciously drawn to the idea that it must
be a sweet enough task to kiss a pair of pretty lips.
Further to this line of thought, he deemed that it might
be pleasanter still to kiss a pair of pouting lips. And
here his investigation stopped short in a sharp surprise
that such considerations could find a place in his over-stocked
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clearly he must have changed in some important
features. Was it a sign of age or youth? he asked himself.
He became aware that his feet rang heartily upon
the pavement, and when he filled his lungs with good air
the life quickened in his veins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s youth,” he said aloud—“youth!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the astonishment of a passer-by he stretched out
his arms luxuriously and laughed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m young—young!” Then with a wave of self-pity:
“Lord! I’ve worked hard!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Even the most virtuous of men are conscious of a
foolish elation when marked for favour from a woman’s
eyes. They do not, as a rule, inquire over-deeply into
the value of the glances bestowed upon them. In theory
Wynne Rendall was not in the least virtuous. At the
club he had frequently remarked that, if lack of virtue
were not such a general failing with mankind, he would
certainly have been a very devil of a fellow. But this
and many similar statements had been mere phrase-making,
designed to fit the wall-space of a conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To adopt a cynical attitude toward human frailty was
part of his mental routine, and in no way sprung from
a natural distaste for sin. Until now sex had left him
unmoved and apathetic. He had watched others
flounder in the toils of emotion, himself unstirred by
curiosity or desire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the discovery of Esme’s pout and his own youth
arose the opportunity to direct the currents of his stored
wisdom upon himself. And, after the fashion of most
men since the world began, he did no such thing. He
made no attempt to consider whither these thoughts led,
or where they drifted, but contentedly let himself gravitate
toward the enchanting vortices so lately revealed to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, on the night on which he had told his wife
that he never knew what he proposed to do, he engaged
Miss Esme in trivial conversation, and found in the
practice a new and amusing diversion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was sufficiently entertained to mention some of the
passages which had occurred between them at breakfast
next day, and thereafter the name Esme—always referred
to in the lightest manner—recurred with some
frequency in his conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, if he were pleased with the affair, Miss Esme
deplored its tedious progression, and did her noblest to
smarten up the course of events. In this, however, she
met with ill-success. Wynne was amused, but no more,
and made no attempt to encourage a closer intimacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are few women who would have undergone
those first months of Wynne’s success as courageously
as did Eve. There are few who would have followed
so particularly, and with such understanding, the mental
processes through which he passed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the Esme affair she attached no great importance.
She realized that any healthy-bodied youngster would
have outgrown the Esme period as he passed from his
teens. That Wynne had failed to do so was a natural
consequence of the starved, brain-fagging life he had
led.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How old Dame Nature must laugh at us and all our
philosophies,” Uncle Clem had said. Very clearly Eve
saw the meaning he had sought to convey. Dame Nature
must be laughing now—laughing at the natural reaction
of nature denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman will always make allowances for the man
she loves, and she forced herself to believe that the period
through which Wynne was passing would prove
transient. When it had passed the real metamorphosis
might come about—and the future promised to each
other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the greatest mercies is the survival of the
hoping habit. In imagination it still seemed possible
Wynne would turn to her with the light of pride and
possession, and call her to his side because he needed her
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So once more she harnessed her soul to wait, though
the collar galled as never before.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>One night Wynne said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall tackle Quiltan tomorrow about backing my
play. I would have spoken at the club tonight, but some
one always interrupts. Think you could provide a
decent meal if I asked him to lunch here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve’s spirits leapt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I could,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, and for the first time, he was bringing his
interests home. Unimportant though his words may
have seemed they were full of the most glorious possibilities.
It meant so much more than asking a man to lunch.
It meant that, at a critical point, he and she would be
side by side to discuss a great step in his future—in their
future. Besides, it would be so splendid to meet Quiltan—to
know and be known by a friend of Wynne’s. She
suddenly realized in the three years of their married
life there had been no friends—nothing but work and
their partnership to relieve the grey monotony of existence.
At the mere suggestion of Quiltan’s coming she
was bubbling over with excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?” asked Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know—only I’m awfully, awfully glad. It’s—I
haven’t met many people lately—and your asking
him—here, I— What would you like for lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven knows! Any notepaper? I’ll drop him a
line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Eve lay awake and her thoughts were good
to own. They began nowhere and travelled everywhere—out
into the unknown and beyond. And because of a
sudden intense happiness she forgot all manner of doubts
which of late had oppressed and haunted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose early and took a pretty dress from a drawer—a
dress which, because he seemed not to care about these
things, she foolishly had never worn before him. When
she returned from the shops she was laden with parcels,
and light of heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne was standing in the sitting-room with an expression
of some displeasure upon his face. The spring
sunshine coming through the windows emphasized the
shabbiness of the furniture and appointments. A
golden shaft caught Eve’s face as she entered, and made
her radiant. But Wynne did not look toward her. His
eyes rested on the tufts of horsehair projecting from the
upholstery of the old armchair—the sunken springs, and
the threadbare dilapidation of the carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve bought a sole,” said Eve, “and some cutlets and
peas, and I’ll make an omelette with apricot jam⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—all right,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I must hurry, for there’s a fearsome lot to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away she went to the kitchen, where she donned an
apron, rolled up her sleeves, and got to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never since the early days of her marriage had she
set about her duties so happily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God’s going to be good to me soon,” she said to the
frying-pan. “I know He is—I know He is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sunshine thrilled her veins with a new sense of
life. Two affectionate sparrows set up a lover-like duet
on the kitchen window-sill. The air was full of young
spring. All was right with the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hallo!” It was Wynne’s voice calling. “I say, I
can’t possibly ask Quiltan to this shabby old place. It
would bias any one. I’ll ring him up and tell him to
meet me at the club. G’bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later the front door slammed. The sound
scared the sparrows at their courtship and sent them
fluttering to a tree below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Eve sat down, and resting her head on the
kitchen table, cried as if her soul were broken in two.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne rang up Quiltan’s number, and was answered
by the manservant, who said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very good, sir. I will tell him.” But when he
went to do so he found his master had already gone out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lane Quiltan was somewhat surprised when the door
of Wynne’s flat was opened by a girl who by no stretch
of imagination could be thought to belong to the servant
class. She wore a coarse apron, her sleeves were rolled
up, and there was a redness about her eyes that could
only have come from tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon,” he said; “is this Mr. Rendall’s
flat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he—at home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” replied Eve. Then, as she realized what had
happened, a smile broke the tragical lines of her expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He asked me to lunch,” said Quiltan. “May I
come in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, please do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He followed her to the shabby sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid,” said Eve, “my husband won’t be back
to lunch. He was telephoning to ask you to meet him
at the club instead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your husband?” He looked at her in surprise.
“I didn’t know Rendall was married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lip—it was rather an unkind stab. He
noticed this, and hastened to say:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is, he never told me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should he?” she answered quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her for a longish while before replying:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see quite a number of reasons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were spoken with simple sincerity, and
they brought a glow of bright colour to her cheeks.
Thinking perhaps he had offended, he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, since he has gone to the club, I suppose I
had better follow him there. I don’t want to go a bit,
and I’m sorry we shan’t be lunching together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So am I,” she nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why aren’t we?” he asked, unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there is no great harm telling you—since
you are here. This was to have been a business
meeting, and Wynne thought the surroundings might
prove—unproductive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” He hesitated; then: “When did he think
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An hour ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Quiltan, with quick intuition, “the
lunch must have been partially prepared?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a pity to waste it? I mean, don’t you
think I might be invited to share it with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something very attractive in the tentative
manner in which he made the proposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want to stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very much indeed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do stay, then—please stay. I was rather— I mean,
it would make a difference if you stayed. But I haven’t
finished cooking yet. You’d have to wait a little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be as quick as I can. There are plenty of books
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He made a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if I must read I will,” he said; “but
I’d much rather help cook.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s jolly of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw his overcoat over the back of a chair, and together
they made their way to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had no idea a sole had its face powdered before
being put in a fry-pan,” he observed, and made her
laugh merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It goes in like a white Parisian, and comes out a
sunburnt Spaniard,” she returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if some sun would do you no harm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare say it wouldn’t. Haven’t tried the experiment.
Would you like to be useful and lay the table
in the front room?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, can’t we eat here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’d rather, we can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Much rather. Everything piping hot, and you won’t
be everlastingly running off to fetch dishes, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so long since any one had minded what she
did that Eve caught her breath in a half-sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had seemed rather cruel that this five minutes’
friend should say the very things Wynne never bothered
to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did. I do silly things sometimes, but I’m not
really hysterical.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seem to know you very well. That remarkable
husband of yours contrived to put a lot of you into the
characters of my play. I used to puzzle about it—used
to wonder where his extraordinary intimate knowledge
came from.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve was all enthusiasm in a second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You really mean that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course. He used to show the women what to do
in the most amazing way. Now I can see the source
of his wisdom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s made me happy. It’s nice to feel one is of
use, isn’t it? There are some knives and forks in the
box there, and the plates are in the dresser.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was because she could feel his eyes resting inquiringly
upon her that she gave him this sudden direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they sat down to the first course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is jolly,” said Quiltan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a change for you. I wonder—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only whether you would think it quite so jolly if
it were all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For awhile he made no reply, then he laid down his
knife and fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” he said, “shall we be friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure we shall be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean— Well, this meeting of ours was never
really intended, so one might excusably assume that
it had never taken place. Wouldn’t we be justified,
then, in talking to one another as we might have talked
to ourselves if we had been alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve shivered. “It might not be a happy conversation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even so—why not? We could be as honest as
dreams are, and what we said could be as easily forgotten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m frightened of dreams,” said Eve. “They never
come true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you tell me one that hasn’t come true? If
it hasn’t come false there is hope for it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose there is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t you tell me that dream?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you promise to wake up and forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so, rather haltingly, but with growing confidence,
Eve told the stranger of her hopes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can see clearly now, it was a companion Wynne
needed, that’s all—a mental companion. Had I been
a man I might have entered more deeply into his life.
You see, we fought to rise out of this rut, and now
he has begun to rise he finds that I am part of the rut—something
to be left behind. I believe a man and
woman were not intended to live together as we have—there
was no fire, you see—we were just partners.
The marriage link cannot be welded without fire. I
wonder—do you understand what I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wynne’s was all mental fire. The embers of his
love for me have never glowed into a flame.” She
laughed to smother a sob. “They are out—out altogether—dead
and cold! At least it seems so. I have
been like a book to him—an information bureau and
debating society in one. Ever ready to supply the
thoughts that were not self-revealing. And now I have
been read from cover to cover, and it’s foolish, I suppose,
to expect a place in the new library.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a damnable story!” said Quiltan, with sudden
fierceness. “I feel like—kicking him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t feel like that. Everybody has wanted to
kick Wynne. It was the first thing which drew me
toward him. And when you look at it all from his
point of view, you <span class='it'>can see</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>You</span> find excuses for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Easily.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How—how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And I’d go through just such another three
years if I thought that he would love me at the end—gladly
I would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But suppose he never does love you! What then?
How long can you last out like this? Don’t you want
to live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I want to live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But all the folk who want to live can’t have their
way. Perhaps I shall just go on wanting till even the
want dies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s unthinkable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But very possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She became suddenly aware of the intensity of his
expression. The sinews of his close-shut hands showed
white, and in his eyes burnt a strange fire. An odd
fear seized her, and to cover her nervousness she quoted
at random.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you remember the Browning lines:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“ ‘Some with lives that came to nothing,</p>
<p class='line0'>Some with deeds as well undone,</p>
<p class='line0'>Death came tacitly and took them where they never see the sun.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He seized on the purport of a single line, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t the alternative better, perhaps, than this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death?” she queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Some with deeds as well undone.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke with a queer hoarseness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment she held his eyes steadily, then with
quick colour turned away her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought,” she said, “we were to be friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you had enough of friendship?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had thought he would recover himself at the
rebuke, but if anything his voice was more insistent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no need for you to make love to me, Mr.
Quiltan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?” he retorted. “How can you
possibly say that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and moved some plates to the dresser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you were sorry for me, and thought that
the kindest way to show it. You were wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His reply was unexpected:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you possibly say I was wrong? You don’t
know—you don’t know what may have happened to
me since I came here. If I made you think I am a
lover by trade I apologize—for it’s the last thing I
would have you believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scarcely knew what to answer, but there was no
need, for he started afresh:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“D’you know, I have never been in love with any
one before. I have never even made love to any one;
but, by God! I want to make love to you. The instant
you opened the door I knew something had happened
to me. I’m in love with you—do you understand?—absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Despite the startled fear these crazy words awoke,
Eve could not but feel a sudden impulse of warmth.
In the midst of the passionless monotony of her life—at
a time when her every thought was doubting if she
possessed any one quality to endear—came this sudden
avowal, backed by a sincerity that could not be misunderstood.
The very surprise written on his face testified
that he meant all he had said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So they looked at each other with the greatest perplexity,
and only the silliest, most conventional phrase
found its way to Eve’s lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m married,” she said. “You forget. You
mustn’t speak so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I deny your marriage, so why shouldn’t I speak
as I feel? I must speak.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I ask you not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands fell to his sides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why do you ask me not? Is it nothing to hear of
love, even though you may not need it? Oh, I⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a step toward her, then turned sharply away.
Presently he laughed:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! I said we’d be as honest as dreams are—and
we have been. You know how dreams go—leaping from
rock to rock—clearing all difficulties—you and the
subject to the predestined end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the predestined end?” said Curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To make you happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that a part of love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All of mine,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stretched out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re rather good. I’m glad you came, you
have given me back what I had lost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve given me hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could give you reality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hope is better, New Friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until it dies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It shan’t die,” said Eve, with a sudden fierceness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if it should, would not reality help you to forget?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How would you know if hope had died?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If—if he failed me altogether,” she slowly answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” said Quiltan.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne Rendall was not a little irritated at Quiltan’s
failure to keep the appointment. He lunched alone
at the club, and for want of better occupation strolled
round to the theatre afterwards. He walked on to the
stage at the very moment Miss Esme was beginning
her scene, and, observing him, this young lady very
promptly gave up all attempts to proceed, and said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do wish you wouldn’t come to rehearsals—you
frighten me most dreadfully.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along, Miss Waybury,” insisted the stage
manager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Wynne held up his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit. We’ll go over it together. Take the
rest through, Henson, and read for Miss Waybury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way to a comfortable office which had
been set aside for his use, and nodded Esme toward
one of the big leather chairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now then, what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You frighten me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Umps!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t believe it,” said Wynne. “You’re up to
some mischief, you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme pouted and looked at him demurely for just
the right length of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme hesitated. “Well, I can’t help liking you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heroic announcement of an infatuated young lady.
And now what good purpose do you suppose that will
serve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the first guess!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’re so stand off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would the purpose be any better if I weren’t?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, think.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You’re horrid—you’re trying to tie me up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Believe me!” Wynne negatived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, in words—and I can’t talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eloquent in other ways?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. That pout, for instance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You <span class='it'>are</span> horrid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I like the pout. You pout ever so much better
than you act—you should stick to pouting. Pout
now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, just a little one—one small pout.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I insist.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t make me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme covered her mouth with her hand. “Now what
are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait—go on waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very slowly she lowered her hand, and for a short
second he saw the little red lips screwed up in obedience
to his command. Absurd as it may seem, the foolish
conquest gave him a perplexing thrill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again,” he said. “It was too short.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Esme, shaking her head. “I shan’t do
it again. You’re laughing at me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and moved a little toward him and the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what’s wrong with that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t want to be laughed at—not by you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt if you know what you do want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Tany rate I shan’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful independence!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go back now, please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never neglecting her studies for an instant!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme came level with him and laid her hand on the
door knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes,” she began, “I think—I think⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you are a very good little boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She opened the door, but as quickly he closed it
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes rested on the pattern of the carpet. There
was brighter colour on Wynne’s cheeks as he repeated:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I said.” Her eyes were still lowered.
“ ’Course I don’t blame you—some people are born
good—some people can’t help it—some people aren’t
plucky enough to be anything else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stood without moving, while new and insane
senses started to pulse in his side and throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then very slowly Esme raised her chin and looked
at him, her eyes half hidden by their lids, her lips
curled in a moist, mocking pout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In an instant Wynne’s arms fastened round her, but
she pressed away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t kiss me—you mustn’t. If you did I
don’t know what would happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care,” said Wynne, madly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So having won her pretty little battle she struggled
no more, but put her lips where best they might be
reached.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Five minutes later he was speeding northward in
a taxi. He had given the driver his home address,
but he said a second later:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; drive me out Hampstead way—keep going—any
old where.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he lay back and let the wind rush through his
hair, while his thoughts ran riot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His last words to Esme had been:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a few days—I’ll arrange something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had meant it—he meant it still. She was nothing
to him—only youth. But youth was splendid. What
did anything else matter? He felt like some wild young
thing of the forests when the “spring running” was
in the air. A great sense of release possessed him. It
was unlike any other sensation he had ever known. He
was amazed it should have sprung from so trivial a
source, but ignored to inquire more deeply into this
line of thought. Had he but known it, the change that
had come about in him—that curious, half-wicked ecstasy—was
of the same emotional coinage that attacks the
average boy when first he kisses a pretty chambermaid
in the dark of a dormitory corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the taxi climbed the Hampstead hill his thoughts
turned to Eve, and he wondered how he should approach
her in the telling of the affair. After all, there was
nothing to tell yet—but later there would be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his insane exuberance he decided that he would
make no attempt to mask his actions. If he were not
ashamed he would not act as though he were. Emphatically
not. Let people say what they might, he would
steer his own course—go his own way for all the world
to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would Eve mind a great deal? Why should she?
After all, there was but a partnership of brain and
work which bound each to each. He wondered even
if there would be any infidelity in what he proposed
to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what had infidelity or partnership, or obligation
or anything else, to do with it? He was an artist,
unruled by law or convention. If he desired an excess
of the brain he had indulged the desire—why not, then,
an excess of the body.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the middle of the Heath he left the taxi, and
tramped across the soft turf. He walked fast and in
a large circle. As he went he sang to himself, and
once, hat in hand, chased a butterfly as a schoolboy
might have done. In the little clearing among the trees
he came upon some boys and girls playing a boisterous
laughing game. The girls were flappers with short
skirts, and cheeks rosy with running. He stayed to
watch them, and, fired by enthusiasm, shouted encouragement
to pursuer and pursued. One of the bolder shouted
back that he should join in, and without a thought he
threw aside his coat and was racing and laughing with the
rest. The game was postman’s knock, and as postman
he caught the prettiest after a spirited chase, and kissed
her as they collapsed into the tangled brambles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still laughing and breathless, he picked up his coat
and followed his way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun was falling red, and the chill evening air
tasted like champagne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Champagne—yes—he would go to the club and drink
champagne—lots of it. He wanted to hear men talk—listen
to and applaud their tales of adventure. He had
laughed at them—hurled at their frailty lampoons
through the press, and yet tonight he would laugh with
them—yes, with them, for they were right, and he, for
all his wisdom, had been wrong—wrong—wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>God gave unto each man one life—to make the most
of. That was the wise man’s creed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He arrived at the club about seven o’clock, and was
informed that a gentleman was waiting to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want to see anybody. Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The page produced a card bearing the name, “Mr.
Sefton Wainwright,” and below, “New British Drama
Association.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every one had heard of the New British Drama Association.
It was rumoured that it would be the greatest
and most progressive theatrical enterprise in England.
The scaffold-poles of the façade of their splendid new
theatre were already being taken down, and it was said
that the opening would be in the coming autumn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long had he been waiting?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly an hour, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he deserves to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wainwright was very affable, also he was very
businesslike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We want three producers on our permanent staff—a
business producer, a classic producer, and one with a
<span class='it'>flair</span> like yourself. We mean to do things at our theatre,
Mr. Rendall!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a writer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much the better. You’ll have plenty of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I’m a mercenary too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A thousand a year any good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have lived on less,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I repeat, what about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll do a play of mine I’ll think more kindly
of the offer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send it right along. And in the meantime⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You let me know about the play and I’ll let you
know about the producing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well—today is Friday. Shall we say Friday
week?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll come and see you at eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you like the idea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like everything. I’m in love with the world today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At dinner Wynne drank a large quantity of champagne,
and insisted that every one else in the immediate
neighbourhood should do likewise. As he drank his
spirits rose, and so also did his voice. There was a great
deal of laughter and much wit—and the wit was accorded
more laughter than it deserved. After dinner there
were brandies and sodas and more wit—lots of wit—so
much wit that every one was witty at once and missed
their neighbour’s scintillations. Under the influence of
the brandies and sodas wit ripened to adventure. Many
and glorious were the adventures recited, and it seemed
that all save Wynne had adventured deeply. He leaned
against the mantelshelf and looked at the brave with
bright eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you marvellous Lotharios!” he cried. “To
think that you, Anson—and you, too, Braithwaite—should
have adventured along paths denied to myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many wise heads were shaken at this improbable
suggestion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, no, I assure you—innocent, my lords and
gentlemen—hand on heart I say it” (much laughter
and ironical cheers). “But I will turn over a new leaf.
The spring is in the air—the call! Guide me with your
wise lights to glades of Eros, for honestly”—he dropped
into the commonplace—“if I ran away with a girl I
shouldn’t know where to run. Tell me, some one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depends on how secret you wish to be,” the some
one replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Secret no—to hell with subterfuge!” cried Wynne,
who had many drinks beneath his waistcoat. “Love
is for the light, the sunshine, and the sea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing for it but the Cosmopolis, Brighton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right—every time. Marvellous Lotharios! Every
time right. The Cosmopolis, Brighton. I shan’t forget—write
it down, some one, ’case I do. Hullo, that
you Quiltan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lane Quiltan, who had entered the room five minutes
earlier, nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Made an appointment, and you didn’t turn up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lost a fine chance! Might have had an interest in
something of mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Had your chance—didn’t take it. Too late now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it?” said Quiltan.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine Rendall lay in bed and
watched the sun-patterns of the string-coloured
pile carpet. The birds on the lettuce-green
trees of Kensington Square sang gaily of summer and
their adventurous flights from the roof of John Barker’s
to the happy hunting ground of Earl’s Court. It was
a good day, he reflected, a day full of scent and harmony,
and yet for some reason he felt oppressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Parsons,” he said, as his man entered with a small
tea-tray. “Parsons, I have an impression that I am
not going to enjoy myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope that won’t be so, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I, Parsons; but I fear the worst. How old
am I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifty-one and three months.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not very old—but it’s too old!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. But I should like always to be young
enough to go courting when summer’s here. Dreadful
thing when one loses the inclination to court, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t say, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’re not fifty-one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was not my meaning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me, if one can’t go courting oneself one
should show the lanes to others. Know any one, Parsons,
to whom I could show the lanes? I’d be an awful good
guide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I rather fancy, sir, young folk find ’em pretty easy
without help.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wrong there—they don’t—least some don’t;
they stick to the barren moor and the wind-swept places.
Not very good tea this morning, Parsons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Twouldn’t have been good, anyhow. I’m in for
a bad day. I can feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parsons laid out a tweed suit and a cheerful necktie,
and placed a silk dressing-gown over the bedrail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ready for your bath, sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, turn it on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parsons retired and returned a few moments later
with the announcement:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A gentleman has called to see you, sir. I told him
you wasn’t up, but he asked permission to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Lane Quiltan, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiltan, oh, yes—yes, wrote that play at the—.
What’s he after?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, sir. Looked a bit worried, I thought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! I don’t know the fellar. What’s he like?
Think he’d care for me in my dressing-gown?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I could ask, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ask, and tell him if he wants me in a suit he
can’t have me at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine Rendall swung his feet to the floor as
the door closed and felt for his slippers. He pulled
on the bandanna dressing-gown, lit a cigarette, and
combed his hair. As he did so he sang cheerfully a
song written to the occasion:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“I don’t know the fellar,</p>

<p class='line0'>I don’t know the fellar,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or who the hell he is.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>At the conclusion he became aware of the reflection
of a stranger in the mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo! Mr. Quiltan,” he said. “Excuse my song—went
with the comb strokes. Liked your play no end—top
hole! Sit down, won’t you. What you come to
see me for, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s difficult to answer,” he replied, “for really I
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the style. Just a friendly visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not altogether. I want to talk to some one—and I
chose you. I’m in love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I envy you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t, for I’m as miserable as hell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all a part of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all a part of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want to know with whom I’m in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it concern me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a way it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fire ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wynne Rendall is your nephew, isn’t he? I’m in
love with his wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine shot a quick, fierce glance at his visitor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Well, hadn’t you better get over it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not sure that I want to. Not at all sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m glad you came to see me. Why did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your name occurred last night. She said that you
understood. Well, I want you to understand, that’s
all; to understand that, if anything goes wrong, it’s her
husband’s fault, not hers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And not yours?” The question was very direct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, by God, I believe not mine either. I want her
to be happy—I think of nothing else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know the life she’s led!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t that answer the question? He treats her as
if she didn’t exist. I verily believe he isn’t even conscious
of her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she in love with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan hesitated. “Not yet—but I think I could
make her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! Make her love you that you may make her
happy, eh? Roundabout scheme, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She shall be happy. I’m determined on that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very sympathetic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem’s voice softened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you are,” he said. “Tell me—what’s the
trouble there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s cheated her, and used her as a ladder to climb
from her world. It’s a damnable enough story—d’you
want to hear it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—no—no. I can fill in the gaps. But look here!
D’you think a lover will make up for what she’s lost?
And are you sure she has lost? That’s the point to decide.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say he ignores her—isn’t conscious of her⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But imagine what might happen if he were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He never will be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Absolutely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you known her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met first last Friday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And today’s Thursday. Six days?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve met every day since.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does he know that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you wanted her to be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do, but why should I tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love is a light sleeper—who wakes very easily.
Tell him—wake him up. The boy is drunk with success—blind
drunk. Are you going to steal from a blind
man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shan’t tell him,” said Quiltan, slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, because you’re a coward. Frightened of losing
ground. Her happiness! You don’t give a damn for it
beside your own.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not true. If I refuse to tell him, it’s because
he wouldn’t care if I did. God! he isn’t even faithful
to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine Rendall sprang to his feet and dropped a
hand on Quiltan’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re inventing it—inventing it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He boasted at the club the other night of a girl
he would take to Brighton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was drunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had been drinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who listens to a drunken man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He was sober enough to mean it. Besides, it’s true.
I know the girl—Esme Waybury, a pretty, flaxen little
strumpet—week-end wife to any bidder—understudying
at the theatre. You needn’t doubt the facts. Half the
company knows by this time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clem rapped his closed fist upon the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hate this,” he exclaimed, “hate it! What will she
do—Eve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows. It’ud be the last knock. God knows
how she’ll take it. Anything might happen—she’s extraordinary,
and she’s counted on him so much—built
up a future of hopes. It’s pitiable. If he fails her altogether⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As he will tomorrow night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tss!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds sordid enough, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As I said—anything. She might jump off a bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or fall into your arms, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment or two Clementine paced the floor of
the bedroom, his brows creased and his chin down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s it all going to lead? How are we going to
pull ’em out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. For the boy’s worth saving when he comes to
life. I’m sorry for him—damn sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think he’s worth it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Worth it? Of course he’s worth it. One can see—you
can’t, perhaps, but I can—why this has happened.
She knows too. One gets a true perspective right down
the aisle of all those straining, striving years through
which he struggled. A boy of no physique, whose mind
was a great question-mark, and a mighty desire to find
the answer. That was all that mattered—Nature could
go hang. He’s dragooned that body of his to carry the
mind to the places where the answers might be found—worked,
toiled, sweated, starved for that ideal, asking
no help, accepting no charity, driving, driving forward
on the fuel of his own brain. Then she came—the all-understanding
she—and took half the burden from his
shoulders, and built up his neglected body to the likeness
of a man. Nature was coming back! She knew
his ideals, and wanted him to realize them—gave up herself
that he might realize them, for there was a promise
in his eyes that she and the ideals might be one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will it come true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God knows; but He does not put promises there for
nothing. It’s all outside their reach now. Now Nature
is taking a hand—cruel, tempting, thrilling old Nature.
She’s found the untried subject, and is whispering her
thousand impulses in his ear. Take your mind back,
Quiltan. Can’t you remember how it was? Can’t you
recall the first pretty face you kissed, for no better reason
than a whisper of Nature’s that today it would be
different from what it had been before. And wasn’t
it different? And didn’t Nature whisper to you that
night of a thousand other differences? And didn’t you
tremble and wonder, and wasn’t curiosity alive in you?
Oh, man, it comes to all of us sooner or later, and the
later it comes the more devil there is to pay. A boy
is young enough to be afraid and old enough to live
clean; but a man is not afraid, and when his passions
come to life they rule him through and through, and
no damned power on earth can turn them aside.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t much hope, then, for her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It looks like that. But we’ve got to try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you going to see him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for an instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know. Perhaps something will turn up. But
you’ll give her her chance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on, man!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Word of honour?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Word of honour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good. Where can I find you tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got my card. I’ll stop in all day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a good chap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan rose and moved toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-bye, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Bye.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne rose from the breakfast table and took a step
toward the window. Then he turned abruptly, as a man
will who has something important to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “Nothing. I—er. No, nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time he had spoken that morning.
They had sat opposite each other in silence, and three
times he had opened his lips as if about to speak, only
to close them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both near, perilously near, saying many
things to each other, but that unexplainable conversational
barrier which holds up the traffic of speech had
risen between them. For six days it had been thus, six
days in which they had not expressed a word that was
not commonplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night at the club it had seemed easy enough to
Wynne to come and tell his wife that red blood was
coursing in his veins, and white carelessness had thrown
an arm about his shoulders. It had seemed a simple
and an honest confession. She was concerned in him,
and had a right to know. Yet try as he would his pluck
broke down before the ordeal. He could do no more
than look at her furtively and postpone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne hated himself when he shirked a deed. Want
of courage galled him, and the knowledge that he lacked
the temerity to put his intentions into words seemed
to clip the wings of the new mad impulses which possessed
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the while Eve knew there was something he
wanted to say, but she could not fathom what manner
of thing it might be. Thus from his silence grew her
own, each waiting for the other to begin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day before he had telephoned to the Cosmopolis
for rooms. He and Esme were going down by the 9.15
that night. As an understudy it was easy for her to be
released from appearing at the theatre on the Saturday.
If Eve were to be told it would have to be at once,
for the appointment with the British Drama Association
was at eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put a cigarette in his mouth and tapped his pocket
for matches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Empty,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll get you some.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to the kitchen with these things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she went from the room carrying the tray he
noticed how shabby she was. He was not irritated, but
it seemed wrong, somehow. Presently she returned and
laid a box of matches on the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks. I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall want a box. I’m just going out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got to—er—see some people. Might be rather good.
Do my play, perhaps, and a big production job. Quite
good, it might be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. ’Pointment at eleven. There’s—er—. Didn’t
you want some furniture for this place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you said—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may have done—but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No reason why you shouldn’t have it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A vague hope took shape, but it was too vague to risk
encouraging him to say more. Often before the hope
had arisen, only to fall to dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She made no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No reason at all why you shouldn’t have it,” he repeated,
“or any clothes you want. Don’t you want
some clothes? You do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she made no answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want clothes—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, get them, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all—all you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any clothes,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her uneasily, then at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to be off.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall you be back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably; but don’t keep anything for me if I’m
late. I may—be late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the door closed Eve said, very gently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re having a hell of a life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne went to his bedroom and pulled out a drawer.
He threw a shirt or two and some collars on to the bed,
then rummaged for a suit case behind the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Damn the things, I can buy what I want,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve heard the front door slam a moment later.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At the offices of the New British Drama Association
Wynne met some important gentlemen, and the words
they spoke acted upon him like good red wine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an astonishing play,” said Mr. Howard Delvin,
who was not given to encomiums. “So astonishing that
we propose to use it for our opening event.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought <span class='it'>you’d</span> like it, Mr. Delvin,” said Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like it—I dislike it very much indeed. I
said it was an astonishing play, and that is exactly what
I meant. Your wit is positively polar, there is no other
word; and your philosophy is glacial—with all the hard,
clear transparence of ice. My personal inclination is
to put the whole play in a stewpan and boil it, for if
any man were clever enough to raise its temperature to
blood heat he would have achieved a play—I say it
in all sincerity—of incomparable worth. However,
we’re satisfied, and now well see if we can satisfy
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Wynne departed from that erudite circle he felt
almost sublime—like nightingales sang their words of
praise. A wild elation prompted him to sing, to dance,
to fill his lungs with the thin air of the high peaks to
which he had leapt. With youth in one hand and success
in the other there were no limits to the achievements
which might be his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt a frenzied desire to celebrate—to celebrate
wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lunched at Scott’s, and ordered a lobster, because
its livery was scarlet, and a rare champagne, because
it beat against the glass. He pledged himself and the
future—the broad, untrammelled future—and drank
damnation to the cobwebs of dull care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wine fired his brain and imagination, restocked
his courage, and set his heart a-thumping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Paper and an envelope and some Napoleon brandy,”
he called to the waiter. And when these were brought:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a waiter once—just such a fellow as yourself—a
very devil of a waiter. Here’s a sovereign. Go
and be happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white paper lay before him, and he dashed a
dozen careless words across its surface. The envelope
he addressed to his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here,” he cried, “send that along in an hour or
two. God bless you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose and pushed his way through the swing doors.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine Rendall spent the morning in a peculiar
fashion. He first called on his banker, and, armed with
many banknotes, took a cab to the Vandyke Theatre.
At the stage door he inquired for Miss Esme Waybury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just gone,” said the doorkeeper, “half an hour
ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unfortunate. Now I wonder when I could see her.
Comes out about eleven at night, I s’pose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get out ’bout nine. Understudyin’, she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if you could ask her to wait a little tonight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doorkeeper negatived the idea: “Wouldn’t be
any good. She’s a-goin’ to Brighton by the 9.15, and
won’t be back till Monday. Ast me to have a cab
ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I see. ’Safternoon I’m engaged. But you could
give me her address, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Couldn’t. ’Tisn’t allowed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. I’m her uncle. Right to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He produced silver in generous quantities, to which
the doorkeeper succumbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Esme had a flat in Maida Vale, whither Clementine
Rendall proceeded with all dispatch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the taxi he reflected that he had set himself a foolish
and a hopeless task. Even supposing he succeeded in
buying off Miss Esme, nothing would have been
achieved. To postpone a crisis is not to avert it. Accordingly
he thrust his head from the window and addressed
the driver:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here—I don’t want to go to Maida Vale.
Drive me to Whatshisname Mansions—one of the turnings
off Baker Street. I’ll rap on the glass to show
you.” And as he subsided on the cushions again:
“Heaven knows what I shall do when I get there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found a porter, who directed him to Wynne’s
flat, and though assailed by many doubts, he beat a
cheerful tattoo upon the knocker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hullo!” he exclaimed, when Eve opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you do with a visitor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without waiting for the answer he kissed her very
cordially, and putting a friendly arm round her
shoulders carried her off to the sitting-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you never come and see me I came to see you,”
he announced. “Well, how’s things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, they are all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a restraint in her manner, which even his
cheeriness was unable to break down. He could feel a
sense of crisis in the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Wynne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out to lunch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brain storm!—we’ll go out too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As ever is! Get yer hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve hesitated. “I—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t tell me you haven’t a hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed. “No; but it’s so long since I went out
to lunch, probably I shouldn’t know how to behave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never could,” he answered. “Eat peas with my
knife, talk with my mouth full—never was such a fellar
as me. Come on—lively does it. What ’ud you like to
do afterwards?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Cos I’ve an idea—more’n that, I’ve the means of
carrying it out. Listen to the program: Taxi; a sole
and a cutlet at the Berkeley Grill, with just a little
Rhine wine to help it along. Then what? I suggest
a picture gallery, and you nod—I suggest a theatre, and
you nod a bit more agreeably. Finally, I suggest a
shopping excursion up Bond Street and down Regent
Street, with a taxi rolling from door to door to carry
the parcels; at this you nod vigorously—and perhaps
you smile. You shall have a Crême de Cacao after
your ice, and then you <span class='it'>will</span> smile. The third and last
proposal is carried unanimously, and before we start
we make out a complete trousseau on the back of the
menu card. Outside and inside we’ll get the lot. What
do you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve leant over and touched his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It sounds so lovely,” she said in a trembling voice;
“but what do I want with a trousseau?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Want with it? Every one wants a trousseau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If anybody cared how you looked in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Uncle Clem’s forehead clouded, and his eyes rested
upon her. As he looked he noted how sadly she was
dressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Little Eve,” he said, “has he ever seen you in a
trousseau? I mean—look here, my dear, we men are
such poor trivial, sleepy beings. We only wake up when
something bangs us in the eye. Have you never thought
it might be worth while to bang him in the eye with all
that beauty of yours in the setting it deserves? You see
we get used to things as they are, and never bother
our heads with things as they might be. Don’t answer.
I know it’s all quite indefensible, and I know you know
it too. But just for fun—for a lark—a spree, let’s go
out and do this thing. He’ll be in later, yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he would come to dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’ll fill in the time between then and now,
and I’ll take charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve stood up suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why—why do you always make me feel it will be
all right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will. There, be off and get your hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well.” At the door she turned. “I have a
frock if you’ll let me put it on. You won’t have to
take me out in this old thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you worn it for him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silly girl. Wear it for me, then. I’ll wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the door closed he muttered to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonder why the devil I’m buoying up her hopes.
Wonder where we’ll be this time tomorrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Clementine Rendall was a wonderful host, and he
ordered the most delicious luncheon. He and monsieur,
the faultless monsieur, laid their heads together and
made decisions over the menu with a deliberation Downing
Street might have envied. Monsieur would touch
the title of some precious dish with the extreme point
of pencil, and Clem would nod or query the suggestion.
At last the decision was made, brought up for amendment,
and finally approved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cooking was incomparable, and Uncle Clem
matched his spirits to its perfection. Gradually he
drew Eve out, and by the time the last course was set
before them she was full of exquisite plans for the things
they would buy together. The harmony of the surroundings,
the attention, the good food, and the subtle
white wine worked a miracle of change. Her eyes softened
and took fresh lustre, her cheeks glowed with a
gentle colour, and her voice warmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noting these matters Uncle Clem was glad, but feared
greatly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now for the shops,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had scarcely turned the corner of Piccadilly before
he rapped against the glass of the taxi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barrett’s!” he cried; “we mustn’t pass poor old
Barrett’s without giving them a look in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next instant they were in those pleasant leather-smelling
showrooms, and an attentive assistant was directing
their gaze to rows of dressing bags, both great
and small.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make your choice—mustn’t lose time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I really to have one of those bright bottley
things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course you are; what’s old Barrett run the place
for? Choose, and quick about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long economy prompted Eve to decide upon the
smallest and cheapest. Whereupon Clementine pointed
to another with his stick, and cried:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sling it in the taxi—you know me! Right! On
we go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he did not go on before he had purchased a great
spray of malmaisons at Solomon’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hats, dresses, and all the rest of it! Bond Street,
cabby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Bond Street he was at his best. He insisted on
following Eve through all manner of extraordinary departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, go on with you. I’m old enough to have been
married years ago. I’ll look out of the window if you
like—but if the bill ain’t big enough I shall turn round.
Get busy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Infected by his enthusiasm Eve got busy, and two
great boxes of exquisite frillies floated down to the
taxi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When we’ve filled this cab we’ll get another,” he
declared as they clambered in and took their seats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Redfern’s, in Conduit Street, he showed that he
was a man of discrimination. He paraded the <span class='it'>mannequins</span>,
and bought four dresses after a deal of inspection
and deliberation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But four’s such a heap!” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nonsense. I’ll make it six if you say another word.
Here, bundle off and put on that fawn thing—know it’ll
suit you—want to see how you look! I’ll go and choose
hats. I’m a whaler on hats.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>So while she changed he went off hatting, to the great
joy of the department, and returned with many.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve was very quick, and as she came from the little
changing-room he had a wild desire to cheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lord! You look lovely! Here, try some of these.
Ain’t I a chooser? This one! Ain’t it a tartar—the
very devil of a little hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It!” he cried. “It! Clicks with the dress every
time! Keep it on. Here, some of you kind young
ladies, this lot for the taxi. Bill! Splendid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shovelled out a handful of notes and they followed
their purchases to the street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No more,” begged Eve, between laughter and tears.
“Not any more today.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gloves—shoes—’brollies must be bought.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was inexorable, and it was six o’clock before the
laden taxi rolled them to the door of the Mansions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve given me my most wonderful day,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You child!” he answered, and pressed her hand.
“There are lots more wonderful days ahead—remember
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he and she, and the driver, each burdened sky-high
with packages, mounted the stairs to the flat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Uncle Clem paid the fare, Eve stooped and picked
up a note from the door-mat. She opened it as he closed
the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!” she said, in a very little voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the note and read it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Twenty minutes later Clementine Rendall was hammering
on Quiltan’s front door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had seen what to do. It had come to him very suddenly
with all the force of a strong white light. He
had made no attempt to comfort Eve—she had not
needed that. Wynne Rendall’s note had done its work
strangely. At the death of her hopes Eve had laughed
a careless, wanton laugh. It was the laugh which gave
him the idea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Quiltan—at once!” he said to the servant who
opened the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” said Quiltan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re in love with Eve?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you run away with her—now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At once. Go and make love to her. Don’t be
frightened, it will be quite easy. She knows. Then
take her away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you got a car?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Order it. Pack her inside and get away to
Brighton.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brighton?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I said so—the Cosmopolis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But good God! he’s going there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She doesn’t know that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you gone mad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you wanted her to be happy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thought you were prepared to give her the chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do as I say. Take her to Brighton. She’ll
go—give her supper in the public room at 10.30. Don’t
look so blank, man. After all, it’s ten to one against,
and the odds are with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan hesitated. “It’s so extraordinary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quiltan! if you refuse to do this thing I’ll shoot
you—by God! I believe I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan rang the bell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want the car,” he said—“immediately—and—and
a suit case.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Eve scarcely spoke in the car as they drove over the
long, undulating road to Brighton. When Quiltan came
to the flat he found her with a queer hard light in her
eyes. She nodded in a detached kind of way when he
told her he knew. In the same detached way she
listened to his half-scared, wholly genuine, protestations
of love. She even allowed him to kiss her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to come with me,” he had said—“to come
away now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with a fierceness which astonished him she had
answered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes— I don’t care—I will—will. Seems
rather funny to me! All right. I’ve heaps of clothes—I’ll
come—yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Crawley a tyre burst, and it took nearly an hour
to wake up a garage and procure a new outer cover.
It was after 10.30 when they drew up before the Cosmopolis,
with all its naughty lights winking at the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve laughed as they stood in the foyer, and the porter
brought in her beautiful new suit case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t,” said Quiltan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time she seemed aware of his presence,
and turned with kindlier light in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry. I’m not playing the game, am I? But
it <span class='it'>does</span> seem funny. I suppose we have supper now.
Will you wait, and I’ll run up and put on a pretty frock
for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have stopped her, but she was gone with the
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather nervously he entered the great dining-hall and
ordered a table for two. There were many guests
present, and his eyes travelled quickly from table to
table. Wynne was nowhere to be seen, and with this a
sudden intolerable excitement seized him. It was short-lived,
however, for his next glance lighted on the fluffy
head of little Miss Esme, her eyes demurely lowered over
a dessert plate. Facing her, with his back to Quiltan,
sat Wynne. They were some distance away, and while
the room was crowded it was impossible to see them from
the table he had taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan took a cigarette from his case and passed out
to wait for Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stepped from the lift he thought her the most
wonderful being he had ever seen. Fragile—adorable—desirable—everything
to set a man’s heart on fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a passion he could not control he whispered:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You dear, beautiful—beautiful dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her answering smile seemed to come from a long way
off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took their places, hers looking in the direction of
Wynne’s table, and a busy waiter approached:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, in one minute the supper. Wine? Cliquot
ver’ good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Champagne?” queried Quiltan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose so—yes, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A <span class='it'>consommé</span> was brought in little cups. Presently a
cork popped into a serviette and the creaming wine
tinkled into the glasses. A few guests at the neighbouring
table rose and left, one or two others following
their example.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The company began to thin out, and vistas occurred
through which one could see people in other parts of
the room. The conversation lost its general constant
hum and became isolated and more individual.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“You are a quiet old boy, aren’t you?” whispered
Miss Esme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne started and raised his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What—what’s that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say you are quiet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny old boy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He called a waiter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get me some more cigarettes—these little boxes hold
none at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You smoke too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He played with a cold cigarette-end upon his plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You simply haven’t stopped.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say”—she whispered it—“isn’t it lovely being
down here—just we two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Um.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He crumbled a piece of bread, then swept the crumbs
to the floor. He shot a quick glance at her, lowered
his eyes, picked up the cigarette-end again, and drew
with it upon his plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wish that waiter would do what he is told.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme sighed and stole a shy glance at the clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it getting late?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it? I don’t know—I’m a late person. Ah, that’s
better!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took the cigarettes from the waiter and lighted
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the man had gone, Esme remarked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everybody seems to be going away. Nobody left
soon—but us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’m.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love Brighton. Don’t you love the sea? I do—and
the hills—oh, I love the hills!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite suddenly Wynne said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Must you talk such a lot?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” said Esme, “you old cross patch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A party of people at a round table in the centre of
the room rose and moved toward the door.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Eve and Quiltan sat in silence as course after course
was brought to them. His few efforts to talk had broken
down, and all he could do was to look at her—look at
this woman who <span class='it'>might</span> become his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the party from the round table passed them by
he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Emptying now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Eve roused herself, and her eyes wandered round the
room. Suddenly she leant forward with a sharp little
gasp in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it?” said Quiltan, although he knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ignored his question. Her eyes were wide open
and bright. Then she laughed a cold, quick laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad,” she whispered—“yes, I’m glad—glad.
Look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not notice if he acted well or ill when he
saw the sight he had expected to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you going to do?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know—don’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not move her eyes from Wynne’s table, and
after a moment a puzzled look came into her face. She
had recognized his attitude. He always sat like that,
with his head down and his fingers fidgeting, when he
was irritated. But why now? A sudden insane desire
possessed her to spring to her feet and cry aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Esme’s eyes, wandering once more toward the
clock, met hers, and in an instant Eve smiled and
bowed. Esme looked surprised, and Eve smiled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some one over there knows me,” said Esme, “but
I don’t know her. No, you mustn’t look, ’cos she’s too
pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne turned slowly in the direction indicated, and
saw. His napkin dropped to the floor, and unsteadily
he rose to his feet. He rubbed one hand over his eyes
as though to clear the vision. He took a few quick
steps to the centre of the room—stopped—then came
on again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And all the while Eve kept her eyes on his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside her table he stopped, and looked from one to
the other, his mouth twitching and his face strangely
white.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—well?” he said, as if expecting they would be
ready with explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or you?” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s <span class='it'>he</span> doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or <span class='it'>she</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you see?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We said when we took the leap we’d take it together.
We are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan rose and moved a little away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall want you,” whispered Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t,” said Eve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quiltan walked from the room. In the hall he waited
indecisively. Then he remembered the flash of a light
seen in Wynne’s eyes—a light of possession—wild, primal,
outraged possession. He drew a quick conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m no good,” he thought. Then, turning to the
porter, “I want that car of mine.” He waited in the
porch until it came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wynne jerked his head toward the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of this,” he said. “Can’t talk here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moved to the half-light of a deserted winter garden
beyond the dining-hall, and suddenly he spoke, very
fast and hoarsely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You and that fellar—wasn’t true!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God! But you’re mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You say that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what possible way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are—you are! My woman—mine!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that other one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That! Nothing—it’s you—you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clenched and unclenched his hands. Then caught
at a random hope:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You knew I was here—came because of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands fell on her shoulders and shook her fiercely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For Christ’s sake! no, that’s not the reason!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wild agony in his voice started the honest answer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came because of what you’re doing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stopped, caught his breath, took fresh fear, and
sobbed out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—but you’ve never looked—like this before—you
never looked like this for <span class='it'>me</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever want me to look like this for you?
Did you ever—— Oh—oh—oh!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned, covered her eyes with her hands, and
fell sobbing on to a chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And he fell on his knees beside her, and fought to
draw away her hands, calling:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, God! I haven’t lost you! For God’s sake!—for
Christ’s sake!—I haven’t lost you!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Esme sat at her table wearing an expression of
absolute amazement. A slight but growing tendency
toward tears emphasized itself in her small and brittle
soul. She, of all the guests, remained in the room.
Presently the lights were lowered one by one, and presently
an elderly gentleman detached himself from a
shadowy seat in a window corner and came toward her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think you’d better be going?” he said,
in the kindliest possible way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Esme started.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon—n-no, I must wait for my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me! I shouldn’t do that, because—I mean—after
all—you haven’t one—and he has a wife already.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” she exclaimed, “then that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quite so. Splendid, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But—who are you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just a friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” said Esme, trying to recover a grain of
lost prestige. “I hadn’t any idea he was married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Course not. Not in the least to blame.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fancy his being married!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m doing that,” said Clem, with rather a wonderful
expression on his face. “But, look here, suppose
we do the rest of our fancyin’ in the 12.30 to town?
Nice time to catch it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I can’t stop here, can I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had a first-class compartment all to themselves,
and Uncle Clem made a most favourable impression
upon Miss Esme. She thought him such a nice old gentleman.
He talked of such pleasant things in such a
pleasant way. He wasn’t a bit prudish, and seemed
to think she had done perfectly right in coming away
with Wynne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I do think it was very wrong of him, as he
was married,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—yes—yes. Still, it’s a queer world. You see
he may have forgotten he was married—some folk do.
He may never really have known—but he <span class='it'>will</span> know.
My dear, it isn’t until we realize the wonder of another
that we become wonderful ourselves. You don’t know
what you’ve done for that young man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Somehow I don’t believe I should like to have married
him,” said Esme, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t! No! Well, there you are, you see!
Yet somebody is always wanted by somebody else, and
that somebody else can always make that somebody into
something. Victoria! Wouldn’t be any harm to kiss
you good-night, would it? ’Course not! That’s right
Splendid!”</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
